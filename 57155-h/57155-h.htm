<small>THE PERIODS OF MUSICAL HISTORY</small></p>


<p>The modern view of history is
vivified by a principle scarcely
dreamed of before the middle of
the last century; the conception
which permeates all our interpretations
of the story of the world, which illuminates
our study of all its phases, was by our
grandfathers apprehended either vaguely or not
at all. For them, history dealt with a more or
less random series of happenings, succeeding each
other accidentally, unaccountably, and at haphazard;
each single event, determined by causes
peculiar to itself, was without relation to all the
others. Political and social history, for example,
was an account of battles, sieges, revolutions, governments;
of kings, warriors, and statesmen. Its
salient features were special occasions and individual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
men: Marathon and Waterloo, Alexander,
Cæsar, Alfred, Napoleon. Of pervasive
social movements, tendencies of human feeling
and thought, developments of industries, institutions,
laws, and customs by a gradual process
in which great numbers of personally insignificant
men played their part, little account was
taken. Facts were facts, and had no hidden significance,
no mutual interaction, no cumulative
force, momentum, or direction.</p>

<p>Far otherwise do we interpret the story of the
world. Inspired by the great doctrine of the
nineteenth century, the doctrine of evolution,
first formulated by biology, but immediately applied
to all realms of knowledge, we read in events
a continuous movement, a coherent growth, a
gradual, vast, and single process. For us, individual
events and men sink into insignificance in
comparison with the great drama of which they
are only acts and actors. For us, great popular
movements, instinctive strivings, of which the
men and women under their sway were unconscious,
vast blossomings of vital energy the roots
of which were far below the surface of the human
mind, rise into relief as the true interests of the
historian, and we interpret all particular happenings
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
and special persons in the light of these
universal tendencies. In geology we trace the
continuous formation of the earth through innumerable
years; in zoology we study those slow
but constant transformations of animals which
are effected by natural selection and the survival
of the fittest; in sociology we examine the painful
yet inevitable crystallization out of the human
spirit of such ideas as responsibility, liberty,
justice; in philosophy we learn of the subtle implications
of our nature, and so learning, substitute
a human God for the idols of savages and
the remote tyrannical deities of half-developed
religions. There is not a branch of our thought
in which this way of interpreting life as a process,
this conceiving of it as dynamic and vital
rather than static and inert, has not enlarged our
outlook, deepened our sense of the sacredness
and wonder of the universe, and filled our spirits
with a new freedom, enthusiasm, and hope.</p>

<p>Peculiarly interesting is the application of this
mode of study to the art of music. The expression
of feeling through sounds combined in beautiful
forms, gives us an opportunity, as cannot
be too often pointed out,<a name='FNanchor_1_1' id='FNanchor_1_1'></a>
<a href='#Footnote_1_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> for a much freer and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
more self-determined activity than we can enjoy
in our other artistic pursuits. Because the art
of music, both in its material and in its content,
is less shackled, less thwarted in its characteristic
processes, than the representative arts, its evolution
is remarkably obvious and easy to trace.
Its material, in the first place, is a product of
man&#8217;s free selection; that complex system of
musical tones which he has constructed by many
centuries of work, is his own, to use as he will,
in a sense in which language, natural objects, and
physical substances can never be. Whereas the
growth of poetry, of painting, of sculpture, of
architecture, is complicated and distorted by a
thousand external conditions, that of music is
determined by its own inner laws alone,&mdash;by the
laws, that is to say, of sound-production, of
sound-perception, and of psychology. In the
second place, the content of music, that which
it expresses by means of these freely selected and
composed tones, is purely internal. It is easy
to see that the objects of musical expression,
namely, human emotions in their essence, reduced,
so to speak, to their lowest terms, are
more fluid to manipulation than the comparatively
fixed, indocile, and external objects of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
representative arts. By virtue, then, both of its
material medium and of its ideal content, music
enjoys, among human modes of expression, a
unique freedom and autonomy. It grows, not under
pressure from outside, but by its own inner
vitality; its forms are determined, not by correspondence
with anything in the heavens or on
the earth, but, like those of the snow-crystals,
by the inexorable laws that govern it; and the
particular changes it undergoes in its evolution,
marking merely successive incarnations of tendencies
and potencies always implicit in it, can be
traced with comparative ease, clearness, and certainty.</p>

<p>But however unmistakably musical history
may reveal an evolutionary process, it does not
reveal that process as perfectly regular and uniform.
That general tendency from a low toward
a high state of organization, with increase in
definiteness, coherence, and heterogeneity, which
readers of Herbert Spencer expect in any evolutionary
series, does characterize the growth
of music as a whole; but within the large general
process we also observe, as we do in many
other cases of evolution of any degree of complexity,
many momentary phases sharply marked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
off from one another, many separate and distinct
periods, like the chapters in a book or the
acts in a play. Each period, beginning tentatively,
maturing slowly, and culminating in
music which carries its characteristic effects to
the highest possible pitch, is succeeded by another,
presenting the same phases of growth, but
seeking effects quite different. All the periods
hang together in a large view; yet they are, after
all, diverse in character, and therefore capable
of being distinguished, and even dated.</p>

<p>An analogy offered by certain well-known
chemical processes may help to make comprehensible
this periodic nature of musical evolution.
Chemists have a term, &#8220;critical point,&#8221;
by which they name a stage in the behavior of
a substance, under some systematic treatment,
at which it suddenly undergoes some striking
change, some catastrophic transformation. Put,
for example, a lump of ice in a crucible and apply
an even heat by which its temperature is
raised, say, one degree each minute. Here is a
systematic treatment of the ice, a steady influence
exerted upon it. Yet, curiously enough,
this ice which is being so equably acted upon
will not change its form in the equable, regular
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
fashion we might expect. It will seem to undergo
little or no change until, at a given moment,
suddenly, it passes into water, a liquid
wholly different in appearance from the original
solid. It has reached a &#8220;critical point.&#8221; Continue
the heating, and presently another critical
point will be reached, at which, with equal suddenness,
the liquid will be transformed into a vapor&mdash;steam.
These catastrophes, in which the
physical properties of the substance suddenly
change, are conditioned, of course, by its chemical
nature. They take place in the midst of a
systematic treatment which we might expect to
produce only gradual, inconspicuous effects,
but which, as a matter of fact, produces a series
of events as strikingly differentiated one from
another as the acts of a drama.</p>

<p>It is in a similar way that, in the history of
music, the tonal material used, under the systematic
treatment of man&#8217;s æsthetic faculty, has
been constrained by its nature to undergo sudden
changes, to recrystallize in novel ways, to
take on unwonted aspects which initiate new
periods. When the possibilities of one sort of
tone-combination are nearly or quite exhausted,
the keener minds of a generation, led by groping
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
but unerring instinct, grasp an unused principle
of organization, latent in the material, and
inaugurate a new style. This in turn runs its
course, develops its resources, reaches its perfection,
and is succeeded by another, which,
after due time, is also superseded. All these
periods are but moments in one vast evolution,
successive blossomings from the one root of
human feeling expressible in music; yet each
has its individual qualities, its peculiar style, its
special masters. It is possible both to trace
certain general tendencies through them all, and
to define other special qualities in which each is
peculiar; and it will be worth while, before
passing on to our proposed study of the particular
period of Beethoven, to describe thus in
general terms the salient features of the evolution
as a whole, and to characterize, however
briefly, the individual periods we can discriminate
in it.</p>

<p>In the most general point of view, an evolution,
of whatever sort, is a progress from what
Spencer calls &#8220;indefinite, incoherent, homogeneity,&#8221;
to what, consistently if rather overwhelmingly,
he calls &#8220;definite, coherent, heterogeneity.&#8221;
All low forms of life, that is to say, are so homogeneous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
in constitution as to be comparatively
indefinite and incoherent; their parts, being all
very much alike, cannot be built up into definite,
strongly cohesive structures. A jelly fish, made
up of thousands of but slightly differentiated
cells, and without legs, arms, head, or any viscera
worth mentioning except stomach, is doubtless
a useful animal, but not one of pronounced individuality
or solidarity. A savage tribe, consisting
of many human beings almost indistinguishable
from one another as regards character,
strength, accomplishments, or powers of leadership,
is a similar phenomenon in a different field,
a sort of social jelly fish.</p>

<p>In higher forms of life, on the contrary, such
as vertebrate animals and civilized communities,
the elementary parts are sufficiently diverse to
be interwoven into highly individual and compact
organisms. The variety of the atoms or
molecules makes possible a great solidarity in
the molar unit they compose, since the uniqueness
and indissolubility of a structure is directly
proportionate to the diversity of the elements
that compose it. A man, if he is to attain the
dignity of manhood, must be more than a stomach;
he must knit into his single unity a bony
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
skeleton, a circulatory system, a brain and nervous
apparatus, complicated viscera, and heart,
mind, and spirit. A state depends for its vitality
on the varied characters and abilities of its
citizens; it must have laborers, artisans, merchants,
sailors, soldiers, students, and statesmen.
In the second book of his &#8220;Republic,&#8221;
Plato describes the differentiation of talents
and pursuits in the citizens on which depends
the advance in civilization of the society. Such
an increase in differentiation of the parts, accompanied
by increasing definiteness and coherence
in the wholes, characterizes every process of evolution.</p>

<p>The history of music is the history of such
an evolution. Music began with vague, unlocated
sounds, not combined with one another,
but following at haphazard, and but slightly
contrasted in pitch or duration. Gradually,
under the inconceivably slow yet irresistible influence
of men&#8217;s selective and constructive faculty,
these sounds took on definiteness, were
fixed in pitch, were measured in time, were knit
into phrases and themes as words are knit into
sentences, were combined simultaneously in
chords as individuals are combined in communities;&mdash;became,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
in a word, the various, clearly
defined, and highly organized family of tones
we use in modern music. Two passages from
Spencer&#8217;s &#8220;First Principles&#8221; will bring before
us very clearly the advance music has
made towards heterogeneity in its elements, on
the one hand, and towards definiteness and coherence
in its wholes, on the other. &#8220;It needs,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;but to contrast music as it is with
music as it was, to see how immense is the increase
of heterogeneity. We see this ... on
comparing any one sample of aboriginal music
with a sample of modern music&mdash;even an ordinary
song for the piano; which we find to be
relatively highly heterogeneous, not only in
respect of the varieties in the pitch and in the
length of the notes, the number of different
notes sounding at the same instant in company
with the voice, and the variations of strength
with which they are sounded and sung, but in
respect of the changes of key, the changes of
time, the changes of timbre of the voice, and
the many other modifications of expression:
while between the old monotonous dance-chant
and a grand opera of our own day, with its endless
orchestral complexities and vocal combinations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
the contrast in heterogeneity is so extreme
that it seems scarcely credible that the one should
have been the ancestor of the other.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_2_2' id='FNanchor_2_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> Of the
corresponding increase in coherence and definiteness
he writes as follows: &#8220;In music, progressive
integration is displayed in numerous
ways. The simple cadence embracing but a few
notes, which in the chants of savages is monotonously
repeated, becomes, among civilized
races, a long series of different musical phrases
combined into one whole; and so complete is
the integration, that the melody cannot be
broken off in the middle, nor shorn of its final
note, without giving us a painful sense of incompleteness.
When to the air, a bass, a tenor,
and an alto are added; and when to the harmony
of different voice-parts there is added an
accompaniment; we see exemplified integrations
of another order, which grow gradually
more elaborate. And the process is carried a
stage higher when these complex solos, concerted
pieces, choruses, and orchestral effects,
are combined into the vast ensemble of a musical
drama; of which, be it remembered, the
artistic perfection largely consists in the subordination
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
of the particular effects to the total
effect.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_3_3' id='FNanchor_3_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> In innumerable ways, which these
passages will perhaps suffice to suggest, the
material of music has undergone a continuous,
orderly, and progressive process of development,
from its earliest days down to our own.
It has exemplified, in short, an evolution from
&#8220;indefinite, incoherent, homogeneity&#8221; to &#8220;definite,
coherent, heterogeneity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concomitantly with this special evolution of
the sound-material of music, moreover, has gone
on a more general evolution of human faculties,
which has involved a gradual turning away
of men&#8217;s attention from comparatively low forms
of musical effect to those higher forms which require
for their appreciation a good deal of concentration,
perception, and power of intellectual
synthesis. What was the exclusive concern of
the earliest musicians became, as time went on,
but a factor in a more complex artistic enjoyment.
In order to understand this aspect of the matter
clearly, we shall have to distinguish as accurately
as possible three kinds of musical effect, all indispensable
to music worthy of the name, yet not
of equal dignity and value.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>[16]</a></span></p>
<p>There is, in the first place, the direct sensuous
effect of the sounds, their deliciousness as
sensations. Musical tones gratify the ear just
as light and color gratify the eye, agreeable
tastes the palate, aromatic odors the nose, and
soft, warm surfaces the touch. A single tone
from a flute, a violin, or a horn, is as delightful
as a patch of pure color, white, red, or purple.
To listen to music is, at least in part, to bathe
in a flood of exquisite aural sensation. This
immediate value for our sense of the &#8220;concord
of sweet sounds&#8221; is a fundamental, legitimate,
and important one, to deny or disparage which
is to confess oneself insensitive or a prude. All
music depends for a part of its appeal on its
primary sensuous quality.</p>

<p>In the second place, music has what we call
expressive value. Feelings, of surprising depth
and variety, it can arouse in us, by inducing,
through the contagiousness of rhythm and
melody, tendencies to make those bodily motions
and vocal sounds which are the natural
accompaniment of our emotions.<a name='FNanchor_4_4' id='FNanchor_4_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> These tendencies,
of course, remain incipient; they do
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
not discharge in actual movements greater than
the tapping of the foot in &#8220;keeping time&#8221; and a
slight contraction of the vocal cords; but even
this faint organic commotion suffices to arouse
those vivid feelings with which we listen to expressive
music. It is worth while to note further
that these feelings are in themselves necessarily
most general and undefined, hardly more
than moods of animation, excitement, apprehensiveness,
solemnity, or depression. Their
particular coloring is always imparted either by
words or titles, or by the associations of the individual
listener. On that very fact depend
both the poignancy and the variety of musical
expression.</p>

<p>The third and highest value of music is its
æsthetic value, or beauty. This value, which
springs from the delight we take in perceiving,
or mentally organizing our sensations and ideas,
is precisely analogous to the æsthetic value of
the other arts, as, for example, the beauty of sonnets
and other highly articulated poetic forms,
of well-composed pictures, of finely-proportioned
sculpture, of symmetrical and harmonious
architecture. It depends, in general, on the
perception of unity in a mass of various impressions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
and is but one example of a type of satisfaction
we are capable of finding in all the departments
of our experience. Wherever, confronted
by many objects, sensations, thoughts,
or feelings, we are able to gain a sense of their
coherence, inter-relation, and essential oneness,
we get the characteristic æsthetic value. To win
it is the highest success we know. To perceive
unity in the bewildering complexity of our experience,
is to possess, in the realm of knowledge,
truth; in the realm of practice, character; in the
realm of art, beauty. Moreover, since perception
is a far more active, self-directed process
than either sensation or emotion, which are in
large degree passively suffered, its contribution
to our mental life has for us a deeper charm, a
more far-reaching significance, than that of any
other faculty. Beauty transfigures all elements
that may coexist with it in the mind. In the
intellectual sphere, for example, we understand
far more deeply the phenomenon when we know
its species and genus, and &#8220;science is but classified
knowledge.&#8221; In practical life, all the little
every-day events, the petty pleasures and pains,
take on, when we view them in relation to a conceived
unity in our characters and destinies, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
new significance. Similarly in music, values of
the first two species, sweetness of sound and
emotional expressiveness, can be transfigured by
formal beauty; there is no tone that is not
sweeter when it embodies a lovely melody;
there is no emotion that is not apotheosized by
association with others in a harmonious whole,
or that does not defeat itself when it stands out
single, and will not merge itself in the organism.
No music is wholly devoid of any one of the
three values; but the greatest music uses the
first two only as the materials of the third.</p>

<p>It is easy to see, however, that supreme as
the æsthetic value of music may be, men could
arrive at an appreciation of it only after a long
novitiate and training. To enjoy the sensuous
beauty of sweet sounds one needs only ears; to
be moved by melodies and rhythms that strongly
suggest those vocal utterances and bodily motions
which are the natural avenues of emotion,
requires but a slightly more complex appreciative
mechanism, the mechanism of organic sensations
and their associations in the regions of
naïve feeling; but to perceive the manifold inter-relationship,
and the final unity, of groups of
tones combined together by relations in pitch
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
and in time, one needs a keen ear, an awakened
memory, a capacity for tracing unity under the
mask of variety,&mdash;in a word, a thoroughly trained
and concentrated mind. Musical art could reach
a stage in which all three of its values were associated
in due proportion and proper adjustment,
only through a gradual progress beginning
with stages in which it was but the embodiment
of sensuous, or at most of sensuous and
emotional, values. That it did, as a matter of
fact, go through these evolutionary phases, can
be demonstrated by a brief and summary account
of the actual periods in its history.</p>

<p>In the first periods that we can make out by
theory and deduction&mdash;prehistoric periods that
left no records&mdash;the values sought appear to
have been preponderantly sensuous and expressive.
The earliest savages, like all children even
to this day, who make a noise for the mere joy
of it, probably used their voices and their instruments
chiefly as nerve-stimulants. As in the
realm of color their tastes ran to vivid reds and
greens and blues, barbaric hues that assaulted
the eye with a potent stimulation, so in music
they were addicted to the drums and trumpets,
to shoutings, and wild contortions, to whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
gave them a generous measure of sensation,
whether in ears or muscles. Their motto in art
was doubtless the one which some unknown
humorist, perhaps a Frenchman, has attributed
to the Germans, in all departments from art to
gastronomy&mdash;&#8220;Plenty of it.&#8221; They did, to be
sure, take a certain satisfaction in the expressiveness
of their wailings and shoutings, and even in
the crude formal designs into which they shaped
them, generally by mere repetition of some easily
recognizable formula; but their chief pleasure
was to make a good, rousing noise. Of these
preliminary stages in the arts of dance and song
it is impossible, however, to form any certain
ideas. We can only rely upon conjecture and
inference, supposing that something like them
preceded the stages about which we have more
reliable information.</p>

<p>The earliest music of which historic records
remain is that of the Greeks. By painstaking
study of the musical inscriptions on stone that
have survived the centuries, of the instruments
actually in existence, or described by ancient
Greek writers, and of the technical treatises on
music which are preserved, scholars have been
able to substantiate a very few meager facts about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
the musical practices of the most artistic of nations.
On the whole, these facts are singularly
disappointing. Forgetting that music is the
youngest of the arts, one is apt to expect of the
Greeks that wondrous subtlety and maturity in
it which they showed in sculpture, architecture,
and poetry. A people possessed of so surpassing
an artistic instinct, one is apt to think, must have
carried its music to a high pitch of perfection.
Investigation shows, nevertheless, that the reverse
was the case. Indeed, no testimony could
speak more eloquently for the deliberation and
continuity of the growth of music than the childishness
with which it was practiced by a people
so gifted as the Greeks with every fineness of
nature, but at the disadvantage of living too near
the time at which it emerged from savagery.</p>

<p>The Greeks used music chiefly as an adjunct
to their poetry, and were accustomed to chant
long epics in what would seem to us a monotonous
sing-song, generally if not always without
accompaniment. Their love for moderation and
their avoidance of the passionate, harsh, or over-expressive,
moreover, impelled them to exclude
from their gamut both the lowest and the highest
tones of the voice, so that even their tonal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
material was confined to a range of about two
octaves. The tones included in this limited
range, however, they classified and disposed
with the greatest ingenuity. The intervals at
which tone should follow tone were dictated by
seven arbitrary schemes called modes, and each
mode was supposed to have its peculiar quality
of expression. Thus the Lydian mode, corresponding
to our modern major scale, was considered
voluptuous and enfeebling, while the
Doric mode, an idea of which may be gained by
playing a scale, all on white keys, beginning with
E, was thought to breathe manliness, vigor, and
dignity. They used no harmony, and introduced
rhythm only by the metre of the verses
sung. Consequently it is easy to see that they
can have had from their music but little æsthetic
delight, which depends on the grouping into
harmonic or rhythmic forms of the tonal material;
but must have valued it chiefly for its sensuous
beauty, and for its power to enhance the
expressiveness of their poetry.</p>

<p>It is nevertheless noteworthy that all three
kinds of value did exist in the music of the
Greeks, though the third was still in a rudimentary
stage. As a result of the generally equal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
length of their verses or lines of poetry, the
melody that accompanied them tended to be divided
into equal sections remotely resembling
our modern &#8220;phrases&#8221;; and these sections
tended to balance each other, and so to give the
sense of symmetrical form. Furthermore, it
was customary to end each line with a fall of the
voice analogous to the downward inflection of
a speaking voice at the end of a sentence. These
downward inflections, called cadences, from a
Latin verb meaning &#8220;to fall,&#8221; afforded a convenient
means of dividing off the musical as
well as the poetic flow into definite parts like
segments in a piece of bamboo or the inches on
a tape-line; and in the subsequent development
of musical structure these divisions, marked by
cadences, became the indispensable elements in
a highly complex organism. Thus the Greeks,
in spite of the immaturity of their music, considered
in and for itself, did actually make valuable
contributions to the progress of the art.
Their period was one of promise rather than
of fruition; but it contained the seeds of
further growth. It is often called the Monophonic
or &#8220;one-voiced&#8221; period, from the fact
that their chants were purely melodic, employing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
but one voice at a time, without harmonic
support.</p>

<p>With the simultaneous employment of more
than one voice, music passed out of its infancy.
The Polyphonic period, so called from Greek
words signifying &#8220;many-voiced,&#8221; extended,
through all the Middle Ages, up to so recent
a date as the end of the sixteenth century, there
to culminate in the remarkable compositions of
Palestrina. In duration it was the longest of
all the periods; but this is not surprising when
we consider, in the first place, the almost insuperable
difficulties to be overcome before even
two voices could be pleasantly and fluently conducted
together; in the second place, the absence
of all prototypes or models for the first
experimenters to work from; and, above all, the
surprising distance that separates Palestrina&#8217;s
ingenious, intricate, and beautiful tone-fabrics,
written sometimes in as many as sixteen parts,
from the rude and protoplasmic chants of two
voices, singing an interval of a &#8220;fifth&#8221; apart,
from which they were developed.</p>

<p>That type of chant in which two voices, one
a fifth higher than the other, sang the same melody,
primitive as it was, and intolerable to modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
ears, was to its originators a convenient and
pleasant device. It was convenient because, the
natural range of soprano and tenor voices being
about a fifth above that of contraltos and basses,
choirs could chant at this interval more naturally
than at the octave. It was pleasant because,
while it left each of the two melodies distinctly
audible, it produced by their combination a harmonic
richness that must have fallen on mediæval
ears with an unwonted splendor. Organum, as
this device of singing in fifths was called, must
be ever memorable in the history of music as
the beginning of harmony.</p>

<p>After musicians had once taken the plunge,
and dared to make different melodies sound
simultaneously, it took them but a comparatively
short time (though eras in music, as in
geology, are long) to combine the parts in other
intervals than the fifth, to use varying intervals
in successive chords, to add more voices, and
in general to elaborate in every way their tissue
of tones. Adopting, with some modifications,
the Greek modes as the prescribed orbits of the
individual melodies, they produced effects of
harmony necessarily very unlike our modern
ones, which are built upon the major and minor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
scales, but nevertheless novel and in their way
extremely beautiful. The fabric of the mediæval
ecclesiastical music was made up of a succession
of shifting chords, each very pure and sweet
in itself, yet without those definite connections
with its fellows that modern habits of thought
demand. The whole effect was curiously kaleidoscopic,
mysterious, and vague. Unity depended,
not on the piece being in any one key,
which it never was, but on the melodies being
coherent and expressive. These were the salient
features, the harmony was ancillary and incidental.
One voice after another came out from
the filmy background, sounded for a moment
above the rest, and subsided again, to be replaced
by another. Not only was there no attempt
at a definite series of even sections, built
up into recognizable rhythms, such as are indispensable
to modern music, but any such effect
was studiously avoided. The effort was rather
to make the voices interweave inextricably and
untraceably. The entire mass was in constant
flux and change, a body of lovely and expressive
sound, without a single distinct lineament, or
any conceivable whence or whither. In Palestrina
we have the style at its acme, vague, iridescent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
beautiful with a mystical and unearthly
beauty. Beyond the point it reached with him,
pure polyphonic music, without rhythmic or
harmonic definition, could not go. Another
critical point was reached, another transformation
was imminent.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the seventeenth century,
moreover, there began to dawn upon men&#8217;s
minds various new principles of musical construction
which were pregnant with possibilities
for a far wider and more vital development than
any that had gone before. The rapidity with
which the art now began to grow, ramify, and
mature, the variety of the new tendencies, and
the multiplicity of different styles or orders of
art, such as opera and oratorio, fugue and sonata,
toward which they led, are surprising. In
the countless centuries before Palestrina music
grew slowly and uniformly, like a plant; in the
short three hundred years between the birth of
Palestrina in 1528 and the death of Beethoven
in 1827, it had its inconceivably rich and various
blossoming, and Monteverde and Gluck,
Corelli and Scarlatti, Couperin and Rameau,
Bach and Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven,
were the bright flowers it now put forth.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
Such a rapid and many-sided advance is fairly
bewildering; but it is nevertheless possible to
distinguish in the movement a few salient and
dominant features, more significant and remarkable
than all the others. From our present
point of view, the labors of J. S. Bach in the
fugue and suite forms, and of Haydn, Mozart,
and Beethoven in the sonata form, are of supreme
interest. These labors were guided and
fructified by several new principles of musical
effect.<a name='FNanchor_5_5' id='FNanchor_5_5'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a></p>

<p>The first step toward new fields was taken
early in the seventeenth century by a set of daring
reformers in Florence, who, boldly discarding
the perfect polyphonic style of Palestrina,
contrived a style of dramatic music, embodied
in small operas, in which single voices sing more
or less expressive melodies over an instrumental
accompaniment in chords. Crude in the extreme
as were necessarily the compositions of Cavaliere,
Caccini, Peri, and their fellows, they opened
up novel paths, because they had to rely for their
effectiveness largely on the conduct of the harmonies
employed. So long as the old church
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
modes were adhered to, to be sure, the harmonic
style remained necessarily vague, wandering, and
monotonous; but gradually the composers began
to see that, by altering their intervals, they
could introduce variety and contrast into their
cadences, making one line end on one chord,
and the next on a different though related one,
and that thus they could make coherent the successive
phrases, punctuated by the cadences, and
at the same time set them in an opposition that
made for variety. In the interests of definiteness
of cadence and an obvious distribution of
contrasted yet complementary chords, therefore,
the modes were slowly transformed into the
modern scale, and music became at last harmonically
definite and firm. All the tones came to
be conceived as grouped around certain tonal
centres, which could be manipulated and organized
like the masses in a picture. Thus emerged
the principle of tonality or key, and in the course
of time the device of modulation by which one
passes from one key to another. Still it remained
difficult to get far away from the key in
which one started out, because of the manner of
tuning, which made only a few keys available at
once; but J. S. Bach, modifying the system of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
tuning to what is called equal temperament,<a name='FNanchor_6_6' id='FNanchor_6_6'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
which opens the doors simultaneously to the
entire twelve keys, emancipated music entirely
from the restrictions of the ecclesiastical modes,
and in his great work, &#8220;The Well-[or Equally-]
Tempered Clavichord,&#8221; demonstrated practically
the use of all the twelve keys as an intimate and
compact family. By his time the principle of
tonality was firmly established.</p>

<p>A second principle vital to modern music is
that of &#8220;thematic development.&#8221; By this is
meant, first, the existence in the music of certain
salient, easily recognizable groups of tones,
called motifs, subjects, or themes, which are presented
to the hearer at the outset, and impressed
upon him by their unique individuality of cut;
and second, that subsequent elaboration of these
themes, in varied but still recognizable forms,
which corresponds closely with the process by
which an essayist develops an idea, a mathematician
proves a theorem, or a preacher elucidates
a text. It is interesting to note that the German
word &#8220;Satz,&#8221; often used by musicians to mean
&#8220;a theme,&#8221; signifies primarily a thesis or proposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
in logic, while &#8220;Durchführung,&#8221; used to
describe the development of the theme, means
primarily a leading-through or bringing to an
issue. Thus the process of thematic development
in music is much like any other process
of intellectual statement and proof. Now it is
evident that this process, which is indispensable
to all the higher intellectual forms of music, requires
in the first place definite, concise, and
memorable themes, since it is impossible to discuss
what one fails to grasp, or after grasping,
forgets. As the proverb says, the preparer of
a ragout of hare must &#8220;first catch his hare.&#8221;
Similarly musicians, before they could make their
music logical, had to catch their themes. But
as musical material up to the time of Palestrina
never was definite or memorable, the first requisite
of thematic music was some principle by
which themes could be defined. This principle
was found in the time-measurement of tones. So
soon as a group of tones were placed in measured
relations of duration to one another, an individual
theme emerged, and could be elaborated.
The second great conquest of modern music,
then, was the conquest of the definite theme or
motif, strictly measured in time, and of those devices
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
by which it could be developed in an extended
and logical discourse.</p>

<p>The third notable achievement of seventeenth
century composers was the emancipation of music
from servitude to poetry, and the establishment
of it as an independent art. In one sense
this was but a natural outcome of its new qualities
of harmonic and thematic definition, lacking
which it could never reach independence.
So long as it remained in itself vague, amorphous,
inchoate, it was constrained to be but a hand-maid,
to content itself with lending eloquence
or atmosphere to the utterances of its sister art;
but this condition of dependence, however inevitable
for a time, was nevertheless unfortunate,
and bound to be eventually outlived. Music
is always fatally handicapped by association with
words. In the first place, words impose upon
it a concrete meaning immeasurably more trite,
prosaic, and limited than that abstract and indefinable
meaning to the heart and mind which
is its proper prerogative; the expressive power
of music really begins where that of poetry fails
and ceases. In the second place, the limitations
of all vocal music are in many ways serious. Not
only are voices incapable of sounding readily and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
with certainty many intervals, but they are confined
to a range of a little over three octaves, and
to phrases short enough not to overtax the
breath. Instruments are free from all these disqualifications.
They produce pure tones, without
words, the most celestial of artistic materials;
they can sound any interval; they extend over
a range of more than seven octaves, from the
deep bass of the organ or contrabass to the
shrill and immaterial treble of the piccolo; and
the breadth of the phrases they can produce is
limited not by their own mechanism, but only
by the power of intellectual synthesis possessed
by listeners. For all these reasons, instruments
are the ideal media for producing music; and
never until they supplanted voices could music
reach its complete stature as a mature and self-sufficient
art, leaning on no crutch, borrowing
no <i lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>raison d&#8217;être</i>, but making by its own legitimate
means its own unique effects.</p>

<p>The task of seventeenth century musicians was,
then, in large part, the establishment of tonality
and the hierarchy of keys, contrasted with one
another, but accessible by modulation; the crystallization,
by means of both harmonic and metrical
definition, of individual themes out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
amorphous tonal matrix of previous eras, and
the exploration of means for building up these
themes into coherent organisms; and lastly the
emancipation of the art thus brought into full
life from the tyranny of association with words
and voices. This was an immense task; and it
is not to be wondered at that most of the men
engaged in it never attained mastery enough to
give them great personal prominence. Theirs was
a time of beginnings, of preparation for novel and
unprecedented achievements. The early opera-writers,
the Italian violinists, the German organists,
and the clavichord and harpsichord writers
of that period, men like Cavaliere and Caccini,
Corelli and Scarlatti, Sweelinck and Frescobaldi,
Purcell, Kuhnau, and Couperin, are chiefly
known to us as preparers of the soil, and sowers
of the seed, for a harvest which was gathered by
later, and probably greater, though not more honorable
men. The first composer after Palestrina
who like him overtopped all his fellows, and
brought to its culmination another great period,
was Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>

<p>In Bach&#8217;s style we find, in addition to the
polyphonic or many-voiced texture of Palestrina,
a thematic pointedness and logic and a harmonic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
structure which are entirely unforeshadowed
in the older man. The fugue, a form
which he carried to its highest pitch, and which
was admirably suited to his genius, is in certain
respects allied to the earlier style, though in
others wholly modern. Like the ecclesiastical
forms of Palestrina, it is of the basket-work type
of texture. One voice begins alone, others enter
in succession,and all wind in and out amongst
one another almost as intricately as in a sixteenth
century madrigal. On the other hand, the fugue
as a whole begins and ends in some one key,
and throughout its progress modulates from key
to key with well-planned contrasts and firmly-controlled
movement. Moreover, a single definite
theme or subject appears at the outset of
the piece, and stands prominently forth through
its whole extent; it is announced by the first
voice, repeated at a different pitch in the answer
of the second, reiterated again by the third and
fourth, and subsequently made the basis of an
ingenious, varied, and extended development.
Finally, although some of Bach&#8217;s fugues are vocal,
most of them are written either for organ or
for clavichord. In all these respects his work
is modern, and perhaps most of all is it modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
in its inexorable logic, its subtlety and variety,
and in its poignant, deeply emotional expressiveness,
which is always held within the bounds
necessary to supreme architectural beauty. The
period of Bach and his precursors, sometimes
called the &#8220;polyphonic-harmonic&#8221; period, because
in it the modern harmonic system was
grafted upon the polyphony of Palestrina, remains
to-day, from some points of view, the
purest and noblest period of musical history.</p>

<p>All the time that Bach, in the privacy of an
obscure German town, was writing his wonderfully
intricate and beautiful polyphonic music,
the world about him, oblivious, was seeking out a
quite different type of art. It is a surprising fact
that Bach&#8217;s compositions were virtually unknown
for fifty years after his death, and might have remained
so permanently had they not been &#8220;discovered&#8221;
by appreciative students, much as the
receptacles of classical lore were discovered in the
Renaissance after the long darkness of the Middle
Ages, and made the basis of an intellectual
revival. Bach&#8217;s great works, too, were full of an
undying vitality; but for a long time their potency
had to remain latent, because men were occupied
with another order of art, a different set of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
problems, an alien style. Ever since the Florentine
revolution, when the polyphonic texture of
mediæval music was abandoned for a simple monodic
or one-voiced style, in which a melody is
accompanied by a series of chords, much of the
musical genius of the world had been devoted
to the development of eloquent single melodies,
and of suitable harmonic backgrounds for them.
With the systematization of harmony and the
establishment of definite themes this type of art
became mature. Composers discerned the possibility
of building up whole movements to which
interest could be given by the statement and development
of one or more themes, contrasted
both in character and in key. They saw that the
whole could be unified by general qualities of
style, by recurrence of the themes, and, above
all, by being made to embody, in the long run,
a single tonality, though with momentary departures
from it for the sake of variety. Working
out their idea, they devised a type of structure
which has remained up to this day the highest
and most widely useful of all musical forms. The
essential features of &#8220;sonata-form,&#8221; as it is called,
are, in the first place, the Exposition of two
themes or subjects of discourse, contrasting both
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
in character and in key; in the second place, the
Development of these themes, the exploitation
of their latent possibilities; in the third place,
Restatement of them, in the central key of the
movement, bringing all to a point, and completing
the cycle of Statement, Argument, and Summary.
Sonata-form, of which it is easy to see the
naturalness and beauty, depends for its unity,
not on the equal interplay of many voices, like
the older polyphonic forms, but on the saliency,
cumulative development, and harmonic inter-relations,
of single themes. We may, therefore,
call the great period of Haydn, Mozart, and
Beethoven, the period in which the sonata-form
attained its full maturity, the &#8220;harmonic period,&#8221;
or, in view of the complete round or circuit of
themes its forms exemplified, the &#8220;cyclical-form
period.&#8221; It culminated in the early years of
the nineteenth century, in the grand works of
Beethoven&#8217;s maturity.</p>

<p>After Beethoven, music began to ramify in
so many directions that it is impossible to classify
its phases in a hard-and-fast series. It had
its romanticists, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn,
Chopin, who uttered with freer passion
and poetry the emotional and spiritual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
meanings already heard in Beethoven. It had
its realists, notably Berlioz and Liszt, who, attempting
to divert it into the realm of pictorial
delineation and description, have been followed
by all the horde of contemporary writers of programme-music.
It had its nationalists, men
like Glinka, Smetana, and in our own day, Grieg
and Dvo&#345;ák, who sought to impress upon its
speech a local accent. Above all, it had one
great master, Brahms, who, assimilating the
polyphony of Bach, the architectonic structure
of Beethoven, and the romantic ardor of Schumann,
added to them all his own austere beauty
and profound feeling. But we are too near these
later masters to get any general, justly-proportioned
view of them. It is on the horizon only
that mountains cease to be solitary peaks, and
become ranges, the trend and disposition of
which can be accurately plotted on the maps.
The general tendency of musical evolution,
down to Beethoven so clearly traceable, so obviously
continuous, becomes after him bafflingly
complex.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this complexity need not embarrass
our present undertaking. We have seen
how, in the gradual and laborious, but incessant
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
and inevitable growth of musical art, period succeeded
period as the artistic faculty of man constantly
discerned new possibilities of beauty,
sensuous, expressive, and æsthetic, in the tonal
material with which it dealt. We have seen
how this evolution tended always from the indefinite,
incoherent, and homogeneous toward
the definite, coherent, and heterogeneous; and
how it tended to embody ever higher and higher
values, beginning with the mere sense-stimulations
of savages and leading up to the highly
complex and intellectual sound-fabric of Beethoven,
in which the sensuous and emotional values
are held ever subordinate to the æsthetic. We
have examined, briefly and summarily, the special
characteristics of the successive periods into
which the great evolution has been divided by
those critical points which the nature of its material
determined. With the general view of
musical history thus gained held clearly in mind,
we may now profitably pass to that more detailed
study of the great period of Beethoven,
the golden age of pure music, which is the especial
task before us.</p>

<p>It will be necessary, however, to linger still
a little longer on the threshold, in order to examine
in more detail yet the two scarcely less
interesting periods which preceded it,&mdash;the periods
of Palestrina and Bach,&mdash;and to define
yet more precisely those fundamental principles
of pure music on the efficacy of which its glory
depended.</p>

<p class='p4 center'>CHAPTER II<br />
PALESTRINA AND THE MUSIC OF MYSTICISM</p>


<p>It has been often pointed out by
historians and critics that in their
early stages the arts of architecture,
sculpture, and painting
were the servants of religion.
Nursed through their infancy by the cherishing
hand of the church, they emerged into the
secular world only with their comparative maturity.
Architecture, which in our day and
country embodies itself chiefly in great civic
and mercantile buildings, began with the temples
of the pagan Greeks and the cathedrals of
the mediæval Christians. Sculpture for the most
part delineated, in antiquity, Egyptian or Greek
gods and goddesses; and in the middle ages,
Christian saints. Even painting, which at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
Renaissance became for all time a secular art,
inspired by its own ideals and controlled
only by intrinsic conditions, commenced by
picturing on mediæval altar-pieces and frescoes
the heroes of sacred story, with their upturned
eyes and their clasped hands, and by
symbolizing the dogmas or illustrating the narratives
of its task-master, religion. J. A.
Symonds, in the third part of his &#8220;Renaissance
in Italy,&#8221; in which he describes at length
this universal dependence of art, in its early
stages, on the church, offers the following
plausible explanation of it: &#8220;Art aims at expressing
an ideal; and this ideal is the transfiguration
of human elements into something nobler,
felt and apprehended by the imagination.
Such an ideal, such an all-embracing glorification
of humanity, exists for simple and unsophisticated
societies only in the forms of religion.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_7_7' id='FNanchor_7_7'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
It is not, indeed, until art, nurtured in cloisters,
acquires definite aims, technical methods,
and self-confidence, that it can put off its
dependence on ecclesiastical aid, at first favorable
but eventually restrictive, and essay a
free life.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>[47]</a></span></p>
<p>To this general rule music is no exception&mdash;mediæval
music was the child, nursling, and
hand-maid of the Church. It is true that there
did grow up, in the lyrical songs of troubadours
and minstrels, a kind of popular music that had
in many respects more vitality, individuality, and
beauty than the more conventional ecclesiastical
art; and that the latter, at many stages in its development,
had to draw fresh inspiration from
the humble popular minstrels. But in the middle
ages, when the common people were entirely
illiterate, and all intellectual concerns were in
the hands of priests, who alone could read, write,
and preserve manuscripts and artistic traditions,
it was inevitable that the only recognized music,
stamped with the seal of age and authority,
should be that of the ecclesiastical choristers.
The student of the infancy of music has to direct
his attention, not to the mediæval world at
large, but to the cathedrals and the monasteries
of that intensely clerical age.</p>

<p>For the modern mind, permeated as it is with
the instincts of liberty and individualism, and
perhaps especially for the American mind, naturally
radical and irreverent, it is difficult to conceive
the degree in which all the rites, customs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
and beliefs of the mediæval Catholic Church
were matters of traditional authority. There
was not a word of the liturgy, not a tone of
the plain chant to which it was sung, not a
gesture of the priest nor a genuflexion of the
worshippers, that was not prescribed by what
was considered supreme dictation and hallowed
by immemorial practice.<a name='FNanchor_8_8' id='FNanchor_8_8'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> The liturgy, or text
of the Mass, the skeleton and fixed basis, so
to speak, of the ritual as a whole, began to
take shape in the hands of the apostles themselves;
was developed by a gradual accretion
of prayers, hymns, responses, and readings
from Scripture; was translated into Latin and
adopted by the Roman Church; and became
fixed in practically its present form so early
as the end of the sixth century. When we
consider the almost superstitious regard in
which its great antiquity caused it to be held,
and when we reflect that the musical setting used
with it was considered a mere appanage to the
sacred words, we can understand the slow development
of music in the first eleven centuries
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
of the Christian era. In taking its first steps
music was not merely hampered by its own
uncertainty and infantile feebleness; it was
paralyzed by servile dependence on a text
swathed within the bandages of priestly convention.</p>

<p>The only form of music used in the Church,
up to the beginning of the twelfth century, the
only form of music ever given its official sanction,
was the Gregorian chant or plain song,
which consists in a single unaccompanied series
of tones set to the liturgic text, intoned by priest
or choristers, and for many centuries used
exclusively throughout the entire service. It
has not only no harmony, but, properly speaking,
no meter or rhythm, being dependent for
time-measurement on the prose text it accompanies.
&#8220;It follows&#8221; says Mr. Dickinson,<a name='FNanchor_9_9' id='FNanchor_9_9'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> &#8220;the
phrasing, the emphasis, and the natural inflections
of the voice in reciting the text, at
the same time that it idealizes them. It is a sort
of heightened form of speech, a musical declamation,
having for its object the intensifying of
the emotional powers of ordinary spoken language.
It stands to true song or tune in much
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
the same relation as prose to verse, less impassioned,
more reflective, yet capable of moving
the heart like eloquence.&#8221; Having neither harmonic
nor metrical relationship, it had, of course,
no proper structure of its own; and so long as
it was used in this primary way, sung in unison
or even in two parts at the interval of an
octave, there was little about it that could properly
be called musical at all.</p>

<p>But after a while it occurred to some one to
let a second set of voices sing the same chant at
an interval of a fifth above the first.<a name='FNanchor_10_10' id='FNanchor_10_10'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> This
scheme, which, simple as it was, contained the
seeds of wonderful developments, was probably
first recommended by several practical advantages.
When the chant was sung by two choirs,
one made up of the high voices (soprano and
tenors) and the other of the low voices (contraltos
and basses) the interval of the octave was
practically inconvenient because the low voices
could not use their highest tones without throwing
the high voices out of range, and the high
voices could not use their lowest tones without
similarly embarrassing the low ones. When the
interval of the fifth was used, on the contrary,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
practically all the tones in both ranges, which are
by nature about a fifth apart,<a name='FNanchor_11_11' id='FNanchor_11_11'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> became available.
This was a very practical argument in
favor of chanting &#8220;at the fifth.&#8221; An even
stronger one was the fact that, while fifths, like
octaves, are harmonious and pleasant to the ear,
without harshness or discordance, they are richer
than octaves, and their constituents stand out
distinct instead of merging into one impression,
as do tones an octave apart; so that the practice
of Organum, or chanting at the fifth, was harmonically
sweet and full as well as melodically
interesting. Organum came therefore into general
and wide use in the mediæval church. Hucbald,
a monkish writer of the tenth century, gives
the following example of a fragment of plain
chant &#8220;organized,&#8221; or sung by two voices a fifth
apart:</p>

<p class='indent'>
<em>In patris sempiturnus es filius.</em></p>


<p>The practice of Organum, crude as it may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
seem to modern ears, was or immense historical
importance, as the first embodiment of that
principle of combining various parts simultaneously
which in due time produced all the resources
of polyphony and of harmony. It is
not necessary to examine here, in detail, all the
stages of that long and weary journey which the
mediæval composers made from this starting-point
of Organum to the highly developed contrapuntal
music of the sixteenth century. In all
its aspects it was essentially a growth in definiteness,
coherence, and heterogeneity. The parts
were combined with more and more freedom,
both as to their comparative rate of movement
and as to the purity of the chords they made at
prominent points (less harmonious intervals being
gradually tolerated); the number of parts
was increased, in spite of the great difficulties
that each additional part must have meant to
writers with inadequate experience and models;
experiments were tried in combining together
tunes already composed, popular songs and the
like, trimming and twisting and compressing or
expanding them to make them fit; the device of
imitation, of which more will be said presently,
was introduced in the interests of sense and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
coherence;<a name='FNanchor_12_12' id='FNanchor_12_12'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> one experiment after another was
tried, one resource after another was utilized,
until eventually, in the sixteenth century, the art
of ecclesiastical counterpoint<a name='FNanchor_13_13' id='FNanchor_13_13'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> was fully established.</p>

<p>To this sixteenth-century music it is difficult
for modern ears to listen appreciatively. The
exact value and significance of chords, cadences,
and melodic phrases, like the exact significance
of words in language, depends so largely upon
current usage and the mental habits it reposes
upon, that it is as much an effort for modern
listeners to comprehend mediæval music as it is
for the modern reader to understand the vocabulary
of Chaucer or Shakespeare. Just as
words, in the course of long service, gradually
take on new associations, new shades of suggestion,
and even, in extreme cases, a significance
quite opposite to their original one, so
the material of music, as used to-day, has hundreds
of associations and subtle shades of value,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>developed only during the last three hundred
years, but nevertheless permeating our minds so
thoroughly that it is almost impossible for us to
think them away.</p>

<p>&mdash;Perhaps the most inveterate of these modern
habits of musical thought is the harmonic habit.
It is second nature for us to conduct all our musical
thinking in terms of harmonic relations. We
think of chords as related to one another in certain
fixed ways, as forming groups or clusters just
as definite as the groups of atoms in a chemical
molecule. It is not more sure, for example, that
in a molecule of water two atoms of hydrogen
are engaged or held in combination by one atom
of oxygen, than it is that in any key the dominant
and sub-dominant chords are held in the position
of subordinate companions by the tonic
chord, and that the other chords of the key are
held in more remote but still perfectly fixed relations
with this Paterfamilias of the harmonic
family. We think of the chords in a phrase, of
whatever length and complexity, as progressing
in a coherent series, as intertwined one with another
by manifold relationships, and as embodying,
all together, some one key. For us, every
composition is in some particular key as inevitably
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
as every poem or essay is in some particular
language. We modulate freely, to be sure,
from key to key; but this rather intensifies than
obliterates our sense of key, just as the process
of translating from one language to another intensifies
our sense of the peculiar idioms of each.
Our whole manner of thought would be as indescribably
shocked by a passage which placed
together, cheek by jowl, chords belonging to different
keys, as by a sentence every word of which
was drawn from a different tongue.</p>

<p>Now this habit of thought simply did not exist
in Palestrina and his contemporaries and forerunners;
it had not been evolved. The bit of
Organum given in Figure II is hideous to modern
ears just because it violates at every step our
harmonic sense; it was pleasant to its composer,
whoever he was, because he had no harmonic sense
to be violated. To us, the sound of a tone with
its fifth suggests immediately and inexorably the
whole &#8220;triad&#8221; founded on that tone&mdash;root, third,
fifth, and octave&mdash;and the key we consider it to
be in. The sound of the tone and its fifth summons
up in our imagination the whole chord and
its key just as automatically as the sight of a
horse&#8217;s head arouses in us an image of the trunk,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
legs, and tail that accompany it. This being the
case, the bit of Organum quoted means for us a
series of abrupt transitions from key to key, without
warning, reason, or coherence. It is musical
nonsense, gibberish, delirium. To its composer,
on the contrary, it was merely an agreeable
combination of two pleasing melodies in a harmonious
interval. The chords used had for him
no implications, no necessary relations, the observance
of which made sense, the violation nonsense.
They were pleasant combinations of
sounds formed by the melodies in their progress;
and that was all. Even more striking becomes
the contrast between mediæval and modern usage
in the more mature music of the later contrapuntal
epoch. Palestrina, for example, begins a
Stabat Mater as follows:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag56.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>

<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>
<img src='images/score_pag56.jpg' width='520' height='200' alt='scorep56' />
<div class='caption'>FIGURE III.</div>
</div>

<p class='indent'>
<em>Stabat mater dolorosa,</em></p>


<p>Here the first three chords, a modern musician
would say, are in as many keys. The first is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
triad of A-major, the second that of G-major, and
the third that of F-major. The coherence of the
passage depends, in fact, entirely on the melodies;
the chords they form have no harmonic
cohesiveness. For the old composers, in whose
scores hundreds of such passages may be found,
harmony was still a sensuous, not an intellectual
or æsthetic agent.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of their harmonic style resulted
from their attitude toward dissonances, or
chords containing harsh intervals. Dissonance,
as we shall have frequent occasion to see, plays
an important part in modern music, both as an
indispensable element in design and as a means
of peculiar emotional expressiveness. In the
sixteenth century, on the contrary, dissonances
were admitted in the harmonic fabric but sparingly,
and when admitted were subject to stringent
rules, the purpose of which was to mollify
their harshness. The result was not only still
further to preclude the sense of harmonic sequence
and coherence so essential to modern ears,
and produced largely by the skilful use of dissonance
merging into consonance, but also to
limit the expressive powers of music to that range
of feeling which is aroused by the purest, clearest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
and most mellifluous chords sounding continuously,
without contrast or relief.</p>

<p>But if the music of the sixteenth century was
lacking in harmonic cogency and intensity, it was
not for that reason either incoherent or inexpressive.
It had its own sort of coherence, its own
type of eloquence, both depending on melodic
rather than on harmonic qualities. Music was to
Palestrina and his fellows entirely a matter of
melody, not of harmony at all. The reader needs
only to glance again at Figure III, attending not
to the chords and their sequence, but to the individual
voices, one after another, to see that in
their own way the phrases hang together firmly,
and say efficiently what they mean. Each of the
four voices has an intelligible and expressive part,
and if together they sound a little strange, singly
they are eminently good. The more one studies
this old music the more one realizes that it is all
melody; from beginning to end, from top to
bottom, the mediæval scores <em>sing</em>. They are not,
like many modern works, full of inert, lifeless
matter, tones put in to fill out the harmonies,
and having no melodic excuse for being. In the
modern monophonic style, in which but one melody
sings, the remaining parts are almost inevitably
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
treated by the composer as affording rather
a logical sequence of harmonies than a subsidiary
tissue of melodic strands. In the sixteenth
century, on the other hand, harmony was the
accident, melody the essence; any chord would
do very well in any place, provided it were consonant
enough not to offend the ear; but every
tone must have a melodic reason for being; it
must be a point in a line; all the lines must be
conducted with draughtsman-like deftness and
economy. Melodic life is accordingly the supreme
trait of the style well named polyphonic.</p>

<p>And yet, here we encounter still another difficulty
introduced by modern habits of thought.
To us nowadays melody means, not merely a
series of tones having that sort of elementary consecutiveness
which we find in Palestrina, for example,
but a series of tones divided up into several
definite segments which in someway balance,
complement, and complete one another. The
first phrase of &#8220;Yankee Doodle&#8221; has &#8220;elementary
consecutiveness,&#8221; but it does not satisfy our
melodic sense. We must add the second phrase,
equal to it in length, which echoes and reinforces
it, and the third phrase, twice as long as either,
which rounds out the whole tune to a complete
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
period. In short, just as harmony involves for
us chord structure and inter-relation, melody involves
for us metrical balance, response, symmetry&mdash;that
recognizable recurrence, to use the
most general term possible, which we call
&#8220;rhythm.&#8221; Mere eloquent intoning, without
repetition and balance of phrases, is to us no
more &#8220;tune&#8221; than prose is verse. Here again
we are in danger of letting our own habits of
thought confuse our understanding of an unfamiliar
type of art. The truth is, Palestrina does
not write &#8220;tunes,&#8221; in the modern sense of the
word. He lived and wrote before musical evolution
had given the world that principle of metrical
structure so essential to modern music; and
his style, therefore, lacks definite meter, lacks
all rhythm save that vague one superposed upon
it by his Latin prose text. His music, devoid of
any regular segmental division, is indeed a sort
of tonal prose, as massive and majestic as the
&#8220;Religio Medici.&#8221;</p>

<p>One other technical peculiarity of the music
of the polyphonic period deserves notice here, as
it involved a principle destined to assume great
importance in later stages of art. The polyphonic
writers often introduced successive voices
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
with an identical formula of notes, which by repetition
came to have somewhat the virtue of a
motif or subject in giving to the music rationality
and sequence. They had not as yet, to be
sure, enough experience in composing definite
themes strictly measured in time to make these
embryonic motifs either very long or very distinct,
but they did make and utilize subjects
striking enough to be remembered and recognized.
In this way they introduced the important
device of &#8220;Imitation.&#8221; This imitating
of one part by another, even when crudely carried
out, gave a certain air of intention and fore-thought
to what without it would have been a
haphazard utterance of tones, and in later times,
when developed to a high pitch of perfection in
the fugue and allied forms, became a powerful
agent for securing intelligibility. Meanwhile,
as we have seen, the intelligibility of the sixteenth-century
music depended chiefly on the fine melodic
cogency and expressiveness of its individual
voice parts. Although time-measurement was
well understood, melody was without metrical
structure and rhythmic organization. Harmony
was the art of making pleasant sounds by bringing
the voices together, at prominent moments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
on consonant chords; it took no heed of chord
relation, of tonality, or of orderly modulation;
and it used dissonance with extreme conservatism.
Such, in sum, were the most notable technical
peculiarities of that polyphonic period
which Palestrina brought to its culmination.</p>

<p>Giovanni Pierluigi Sante da Palestrina, named
Palestrina from the place of his birth, which was
a small town in the Campagna not far from Rome,
was born of humble parents about the year 1524.
About 1550 he went to Rome as teacher of the
boy-singers in the Capella Giulia of the Vatican.
All the rest of his life was spent in Rome, in various
posts in the service of the church, and in
studious and uneventful labor at his great compositions.
Although a married man, he was
made in 1554 one of the singers in the Papal
choir by Pope Julius III, to whom he had dedicated
a set of masses; on the accession of Pope
Paul IV a year later he was dismissed, and became
ill with anxiety as to the support of his growing
family; he was nevertheless almost immediately
appointed music-director of the Lateran Church,
and later he held successively the posts of
music-director in the Church of Santa Maria
Maggiore, &#8220;Composer to the Pontifical Choir,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
leader of the choir of St. Peter&#8217;s, and music-director
to Cardinal Aldobrandini. Aside from
these meagre and arid details, unfortunately, little
is known of the man Palestrina. His private
life is almost a blank. The one story oftenest
told of him, that his Mass of Pope Marcellus,
produced in 1565, was written to convince the
reforming Council of Trent of the possibility of
purging church music of the trivialities and
abuses which had crept into it, has been discredited
by recent historians. Mythical also seems
to be the story of Palestrina&#8217;s one great popular
triumph, in 1575, a year of jubilee, when fifteen
hundred residents of the composer&#8217;s native town
are said to have entered Rome in three companies,
singing his works, and led by himself.
The story is a severe tax on the credulity of anyone
whose ideas of chorus-singing are based on
modern methods.</p>

<p>In character Palestrina was devout, pious,
frugal, and industrious. Though so few records
exist, we can guess his industry from the mass
of the work he achieved, and his honor and
sense of responsibility from his anxiety when the
support of his family seemed in danger. As to
his piety, all his music is one eloquent demonstration
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
of it. Nor is it without verbal testimony
in the dedications and inscriptions on his manuscripts.
In dedicating his first book of motets
to Cardinal d&#8217;Este he expressed his artistic convictions
as follows: &#8220;Music exerts a great influence
on the minds of mankind, and is intended
not only to cheer these, but also to guide and
control them, a statement which has not only
been made by the ancients, but which is found
equally true to-day. The sharper blame, therefore,
do those deserve who misemploy so great
and splendid a gift of God in light or unworthy
things, and thereby excite men, who of themselves
are inclined to all evil, to sin and misdoing.
As regards myself, I have from youth been
affrighted at such misuse, and anxiously have I
avoided giving forth anything which could lead
anyone to become more wicked or godless. All
the more should I, now that I have attained to
riper years, and am not far removed from old
age, place my entire thoughts on lofty, earnest
things, such as are worthy of a Christian.&#8221;
When, in 1594, Palestrina died, almost his last
words, whispered to his son Igino, directed the
publication of his latest manuscript works, &#8220;to
the glory of the most high God, and the worship
of his holy temple.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>[65]</a></span></p>

<p>A sentence in the dedication by Palestrina just
cited affords us as serviceable a key as we could
desire to the fundamental temper or mood of
mind which underlay the type of art he represents.
The technical peculiarities of this art already
traced in the foregoing pages, do not in
themselves explain it; they are, indeed, but
manifestations of a deeper spirit underneath, a
spirit that was as characteristic of the mediæval
mind as idealism is of the modern mind. Incommensurate
as were the technical resources of the
mediæval composer with ours, their whole mental
temper and outlook upon life was in even
more striking contrast with the modern attitude.
We have, therefore, next to ask: What was the
most characteristic peculiarity of this age? What
was its most pervasive general trait? What was
the one dominant quality in which most of Palestrina&#8217;s
contemporaries, for all their minor differences,
were alike?</p>

<p>Palestrina himself suggests the answer to such
questions. &#8220;The sharper blame, therefore,&#8221; he
writes, &#8220;do those deserve who misemploy so
great and splendid a gift of God in light or unworthy
things, and thereby excite men, who of
themselves are inclined to all evil, to sin and
misdoing.&#8221; This setting in antithesis of &#8220;men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
who of themselves are inclined to all evil,&#8221; with
the attribution of a &#8220;great and splendid gift&#8221; to
a God conceived as remote from men though beneficent
to them, exemplifies the essence of that
mediæval view of life which we wish to understand,
and for which perhaps the best single name
is mysticism. The mystic begins his philosophy
with a sharp sundering of himself, considered as an
individual existing in time and space, with earthly
body, finite mind, and human passions, from what
he considers supreme, formless, and eternal good.
In common with other men, he has his instinctive
perceptions of the divine; but unlike other
men he cuts off very sharply the divine thus
perceived from the real world in which he eats
and drinks, works and plays, lives and dies. His
is a world of strong contrasts, of extreme antithesis&mdash;the
world that mystical terminology
divides into &#8220;apparent and real,&#8221; &#8220;divine and
carnal,&#8221; &#8220;temporal and eternal.&#8221; His intuition
of what is beyond the veil of mortality, absolute,
permanent, serves only to emphasize more poignantly
his own frailty, partiality, and transience.
He not only hypostatizes his own ideal,
his dream and aspiration of what ought to be,
making of it, as all men do, a real objective existence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
but he then cuts it off from himself,
makes it a touchstone of all the dross that in
him exists alongside the pure gold, and while he
attributes all virtue to this &#8220;other&#8221; or &#8220;beyond&#8221;
projected by his unconscious imagination,
reserves to his present actual self, as directly
known, all wickedness, sin, and failure.
God is perfect, but remote; man is near&mdash;and
base.</p>

<p>This was the characteristic attitude of religious-minded
men in the middle ages. If to us
it may seem pathetically childish and superstitious,
we should not judge it without remembering
the epoch of which it was a part. When we
reconstruct in imagination that historic moment,
that peculiar inheritance and environment of the
sixteenth century Europeans, it is hard to conceive
how else they could have interpreted the
world. Theirs was an age, we must remind
ourselves, of violence and bloodshed, of greed,
hypocrisy, lust, and faithlessness. Craft and
cruelty reigned in places of power, and the minds
of the common people groped in the obscurity
of gross ignorance, made even darker by fitful
flashes of superstition. The poor were ground
down by tyrannies and oppressions, the powerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
were tormented by constant dread of treachery
and assassination. Plagues and pestilence,
war and famine and drought, made physical existence
miserable; priestly bigotry and dogmatism
crushed all mental initiative. It is not surprising
that humanity, in the midst of such conditions,
failed to recognize, as the source of its
beliefs, its own latent virtue; the wonder is
rather that it succeeded in rising at all to the
intuition of a holiness which, by a natural error,
it conceived as entirely severed from itself. It
was much to arrive at this point. The object
of the present analysis is not to discredit the
mediæval conception of the world, but, by pointing
out its peculiarities, to throw light on the
music which was one of its profoundest utterances.</p>

<p>The most familiar, and in some respects the
most characteristic, element of mysticism is its
ecstatic, devout attitude towards the deity or
Absolute it worships. The mystic throws himself
on the ground before his God, so to speak,
in an ecstasy of complete self-abandonment and
surrender. He is utterly prone, passive, will-less.
His worship is the most complete, the most devoted
worship of which there is record. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
Greek pagans might sacrifice a lamb or an ox at
the altars of their gods, the mystic sacrifices
nothing less than himself, his very personality.
He desires no reciprocal relations with his deity,
makes no reservations in his commerce with it,
retains no claim to independence, seeks no special
favors; what he longs for, whole-heartedly
and with a passionate fervor, is complete absorption,
utter annihilation. In the trances of the
devotees, consciousness dwindles to a point, all
sense of individuality lapses, perception, sensation,
thought even, flag and cease, and there remains
only a vast, vague sense of the infinite
self in which the human self is dissolved and
obliterated.</p>

<p>So prominent a feature in this longing or absorption
in the infinite, however, was the characteristic
mystical condemnation of the finite,
that an account of the relations of mystical belief
and practice to the affairs of actual life reduces
itself largely to a series of negative statements.
Closely connected with the dogma of
the supreme worth of the absolute, and producing
even more conspicuous effects than that,
was the obverse dogma of the worthlessness of
the immediate, of whatever could be called
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
&#8220;this,&#8221; &#8220;now,&#8221; or &#8220;here.&#8221; Love of God was
considered to involve contempt of man, and since
man was nearer, more immediate in experience,
than God, mysticism expressed itself, historically,
very largely in negations. It acted, in all
departments of life, and on all planes&mdash;the physical,
the intellectual, and the emotional or spiritual&mdash;as
an anti-naturalistic force, for which,
perhaps, the best general name is asceticism.</p>

<p>On the physical plane, asceticism took the
form of abstinence and mortification of the flesh.
In its milder phases it prompted merely the refusal
of all the natural calls of instinct and appetite.
Because it was natural to hunger, asceticism
required men to fast; because to sleep was
natural, it counselled vigils; because men naturally
enjoy women&#8217;s love, material well-being,
and personal initiative, monastic orders imposed
the triple oath of celibacy, poverty, and obedience.
Of course it is true that there were positive
benefits to be derived from all these modes
of discipline, and that much could be argued in
their favor by mere common-sense; but over and
above their positive virtues there was about them
an opposition to nature, a violence to human instincts,
that even more irresistibly commended
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
them to true ascetics. A still further application
of the same principle was mortification of
the flesh. Indian Jogis, Mohammedan dervishes
and fakirs, Christian cenobites and anchorites,
all, in a word, who held the mystical doctrine of
the absolute opposition of body and spirit, believed
that to mortify the flesh was to vivify the
soul, and carried out their belief with the help
of a thousand engines of penance.</p>

<p>On the intellectual plane, the same distrust of
man and of nature prompted an agelong opposition
to science, to independent metaphysical
or religious thinking, and indeed to all forms of
free mental activity. The story of Galileo summoned
before the seven cardinals at Rome and
forced to deny his belief in the heretical doctrine
that the earth revolved round the sun is typical of
the experiences of almost all venturesome thinkers
in the middle age. The application of human
intellect to the unravelling of the august
mysteries of God was zealously punished as a
blasphemy; the only authorized channel of
knowledge was revelation. The rational and
systematic questioning of nature that has given
us modern science was by the true mystical mind
held in horror, first because the intelligence is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
human and therefore corrupt instrument, and
secondly because nature itself is an illusion, a
pitfall for unwary feet that falter in their search
for heaven.</p>

<p>An asceticism which saw in the physical and
intellectual activities of the natural man more
evil than good, could hardly be expected to look
more leniently on his emotional life, which is,
perhaps, the most intensely human and natural
part of him, and of which the organized expression
is art. Ordinary human feelings, exercised
spontaneously in the present world, and not as
mere offerings to the beyond, seemed to the
ascetic as unworthy of a God-fearing man as sensuous
pleasures and intellectual quests. And
especially abhorrent to him was their free embodiment
in art. As religion is the expression of
man&#8217;s consciousness of the supernatural, so art
is the expression of his delight and joy in the
natural. Its work is to build, out of primitive
sensations, utterances of feeling and monuments
of beauty. But these sensations are all ultimately
physical. These feelings are the simple,
instinctive feelings of humanity, and this beauty
is one that is apprehended by no metaphysical
faculty, but by ordinary human powers&mdash;by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
senses, the heart, and the mind. Art is the most
radically and inexorably human of all man&#8217;s interests.
And since the whole bias of asceticism
was against the free development or expression
of merely human powers, it was inevitable
that mysticism, in which the ascetic element
is so considerable, should be even more restrictive
than helpful in its influence on art. While
it did indeed foster the purely devout and adoring
element in artistic expression, it discouraged that
full appeal to the whole man by which alone art
attains its maturity.</p>

<p>The music of Palestrina&#8217;s age is probably the
most consummate expression in the whole history
of art of this peculiar type of feeling, with all
its characteristic qualities and limitations. &#8220;No
other form of chorus music has existed,&#8221; writes
Mr. Edward Dickinson,<a name='FNanchor_14_14' id='FNanchor_14_14'></a><a href='#Footnote_14_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> &#8220;so objective and impersonal,
so free from the stress and stir of passion,
so plainly reflecting an exalted, spiritualized
state of feeling. This music is singularly adapted
to reinforce the impression of the Catholic mysteries
by reason of its technical form and its peculiar
emotional appeal.... It is as far as possible
removed from profane suggestion; in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
ineffable calmness, and an indescribable tone of
chastened exultation, pure from every trace of
struggle, with which it vibrates, it is the most
adequate emblem of that eternal repose toward
which the believer yearns.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, we must now once more insist, these
peculiar qualities of feeling to be expressed in
mystical art, that reacted to determine the peculiarities
of the technique in which they had to be
embodied, just as a man&#8217;s spirit reacts to determine
the nature of the body in which its purposes
have to be wrought out. That &#8220;ineffable
calmness,&#8221; that &#8220;chastened exultation,&#8221; of the
mystical temper, could be voiced in sound only
through the medium of clear, ethereal vocal
tones, combined in chords prevailingly consonant
and void of harshness. Such a translucent
fabric of tones as was produced by human voices,
singing, without instrumental accompaniment,
the purest consonances, was best fitted to merge
with the vast, cool arch of the cathedral, with
the unlocalized murmur and reverberation that
stirred in it, and with the somnolent fumes of
incense, to form a background apt for mystical
contemplation. And then, against this background,
the phrases of aspiring but unimpassioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
melody which one by one sounded above
the general murmur, traced, as it were, arabesques
of more definite human feeling. One by one
they rose into momentary prominence, to hover
above the other voices as prayers hover among
the tranquil thoughts of simple and devout
minds. There was about them a celestial clarity,
an unearthly plangency of accent, but no
turmoil or confusion, no hint of mortal pain.</p>

<p>Complete impersonality was attained by the
exclusion of dissonance and of meter. The emotional
function of dissonance is to suggest, by its
harshness, and by its sharp contrast with the consonances
by which it is surrounded, the struggle
and the fragmentariness of all finite existence.
Like a cry of incompleteness yearning to be
completed, it is eloquent to us of our loneliness
and bitter self-consciousness. Meter similarly
insists on reminding us of our petty human selves
by stimulating us to make those gestures and
motions that bring into full activity our muscular
expression, with all its mental consequents.
To hear a strong rhythm is to be irresistibly
reminded of all those active impulses in us which
underlie our sense of finite personality. It was,
then, by its negative peculiarities, by its avoidance
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
of all harmonic mordancy and definition,
and of all rhythmic vigor, that Palestrina&#8217;s music
secured its impersonality, its freedom from &#8220;profane
suggestion,&#8221; and from &#8220;every trace of struggle.&#8221;
Its positive and negative qualities thus
cooperated so efficiently as to make it an incomparable
exponent of the mystical mood. It
not only could induce that rapt attitude of worship
which was the kernel of mysticism, but it
also skilfully avoided all disturbing hints of personal,
finite, and secular activities. It comes to
our modern ears like a voice from some grey
mediæval cloister, tremulous with a divine passion,
but utterly void of all those earthly passions
in which the sweet is subtly mingled with
the bitter, and human pathos is more audible
than heavenly peace.</p>

<p>Palestrina marked the culmination of his
school; the pure polyphonic style ended with
him. Was this merely because his younger contemporaries,
overawed by his perfect skill, dared
not enter the lists in rivalry with such a master?
Or was it rather that men&#8217;s minds had arrived
at the period of a fresh insight, and that the time
was ripe for an obliteration of hard and fast distinctions
between sacred and secular, spiritual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
and carnal, eternal and temporal, and for a proclamation
of the native dignity and worth of
man himself, in the fullness of his sensuous, intellectual,
and emotional life?

<p class='p4 center'>CHAPTER III<br />
THE MODERN SPIRIT</p>


<p>The need of mastering life, of reducing
its multitudinous, thronging
details to some sort of order,
that shall lack neither the unity
which alone can satisfy the mind,
nor the variety requisite to do justice to the
complexity of experience, is the one perennial
need of humanity. The aim of all the chief
human undertakings is to find schemes of order:
physical science is the quest of order in
the material world; morality is the quest of
coordination and balance between many individual
wills; religion is the search for the One
Spirit which contains and fuses together all
finite souls; art is the pursuit of that organization
of diverse elements, of whatever sort,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
in one sensible whole, in which we perceive
beauty. But since experience is bewilderingly
many-sided and complex, one scheme after another
is made only to be discarded as inadequate,
and progress entails the constant substitution of
more inclusive for less inclusive syntheses. Our
most catholic formulas are provisional and temporary;
&#8220;opinions are but stages on the road
to truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a word as &#8220;modern&#8221; can therefore have
but a relative meaning. What is modern to-day
will be archaic a hundred years hence. Our
contemporary ideas are more liberal than those
of our grandfathers, but they will likely appear
as the rigid superstitions of a dark age to our
still more enlightened descendants. When we
speak of the modern spirit we say nothing in
regard to the future; we name simply the attitude
of mind which characterizes the present as
contrasted with the past. That new vision or
intuition or instinct of truth by which we of to-day
reinterpret in more liberal wise the elements
of experience either interpreted too narrowly or
quite ignored by the earlier generations&mdash;that is
the &#8220;modern spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have been considering at some length, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
the foregoing chapter, the characteristic mystical
attitude of the mediæval mind. We have
seen how the typical thinkers of the middle age,
aware of good but unable to identify it with an
actual world so full of evil, made a sharp division,
a total breach, between the actual and the
divine. The mystic cut the Gordian knot of
the world-problem by rejecting the actual altogether
from his house of life. His scheme had
its own harmony, unity, rationality; but being
built upon an exclusion, it had in the nature
of things to give place in course of time to a
scheme less disregardful of the true wealth and
reality of experience. The modern mind turned
away from mysticism, envisaged the world
afresh, and reinterpreted truth in terms of
idealism.</p>

<p>Idealism is, in essence, a belief in the possibility
of attaining the divine through a selective
manipulation of the actual. In the respect it
pays to finite life lies its sharp contrast with mysticism.
It has gone far to obliterate the breach
between the actual and the divine which the mystic
had made so wide; it has tried to find the
eternal in the temporal, and to nourish the spirit
by guiding and developing, rather than by mortifying,

the flesh.<a name='FNanchor_15_15' id='FNanchor_15_15'></a><a href='#Footnote_15_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> Mysticism spurned the &#8220;this,&#8221;
the &#8220;here,&#8221; the &#8220;now;&#8221; idealism, on the contrary,
is on its hither side, so to speak, identical
with realism. The idealist believes in the immediate,
and loves the finite, as much as the
crassest realist. He finds in it the point of departure
of all desirable truths, the scaffolding for
all mansions of the spirit. But he differs from the
realist in that he does not stop with the real, but,
using it as material for idealism, selects from
it the elements of his heart&#8217;s desire. The actual
world is to him a sort of keyboard on which he
strikes those chords, and those only, which he
wishes to hear. He is, indeed, an artist in life,
and his method is the true artistic method of selection
and synthesis. But on the other hand,
he differs even more radically from the mystic,
in that he makes the very materials of his Celestial
City out of those earthly, momentary, and
finite experiences that the latter rejects as dross.
All three types of thought find themselves confronted
by the opposition between actual facts
and spiritual desires which is so characteristic of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
our world: the mystic repudiates the facts;
the realist discredits the desires; the idealist
sets out to win, by a selective or artistic manipulation
of the facts, the satisfaction of the
desires.</p>

<p>Characteristic of idealism is therefore its respect
for the actual, in all its phases. It respects,
to begin with, the human body. The tendency
of modern thought is towards a wise paganism
in physical life, towards a substitution of hygiene
for mortification, of moderation for abstinence,
of the liberal conception of &#8220;mens sana in corpore
sano&#8221; for the monkish ideal of a soul
gradually burning up and sloughing off its tenement.
Development of the body is increasingly
manifesting its true relation to the spiritual enterprises
of men&mdash;a relation that repression of it
only obscured and distorted. The Hermit of
Carmel, in the poem of that name,<a name='FNanchor_16_16' id='FNanchor_16_16'></a><a href='#Footnote_16_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> spends his
days in a painful, endless, and futile struggle to
eradicate fleshly lusts; the young knight knows
another sort of purity, more joyful and bountiful,
the purity of the lover who remembers
his beloved. Idealism, like that happy knight,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
remembers that it is the mission and destiny of
flesh to wait on spirit.</p>

<p>Again, idealism respects the intellect. The
great development of the physical sciences, generally
considered the most striking fact in nineteenth
century history, is the necessary result of
an idealistic faith in the powers of human observation
and reason. The modern mind, believing
in its own ability to interrogate nature,
has done so with tireless energy, recording the
answers obtained in half a hundred special &#8220;sciences,&#8221;
ranging from histology to psychology.
It has applied the same method introspectively
to such good purpose that metaphysics, in the
hands of Kant and his successors, has radically
altered our conception of how we know truth,
and what sort of truth it is that we know. Nor
have the contributions of the enfranchised intellect
stopped with philosophy; they have immensely
deepened and vivified religion. The
doctrine of evolution, for example, a product of
the most remarkable keenness, liberality, and
patience in intellectual research, has substituted
for the childish anthropomorphic doctrine of
creation the wondrously vital modern conception
of a God not remote and detached, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
nearer than thought and more enveloping than
the atmosphere, incarnate in every atom and
regnant in every mind.</p>

<p>The emotional or spiritual essence in man is
as much respected by idealism as his body and
his intellect. Loyalty to actual feelings as they
well up spontaneously in the heart, rather than
mere conformity to custom, is the modern attitude
in all spheres of voluntary life. Personal
conduct is a truer mirror of individual feeling
than it used to be. What a contrast the student
of literature observes between the conventional
worldliness of eighteenth-century manners
and morals and the intense individualism of
the early nineteenth-century poets in England
and of our own transcendentalist writers&mdash;an individualism
which was the logical outcome of the
idealist&#8217;s championship of human emotion in and
for itself. The greatest men are of course always
ahead of their age, but such sturdy, independent
lives as Thoreau&#8217;s, Whitman&#8217;s, Darwin&#8217;s, George
Eliot&#8217;s, Stevenson&#8217;s, would have created even
more consternation in the eighteenth century
than they did in the nineteenth, dimly stirred to
freer ideals. The same regard for emotional verities
that has so deepened individual life is producing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
a revolution in all social relations. They
are constantly becoming more spontaneous and
genuine&mdash;less matters of tradition. Class boundaries
are being obliterated, a man&#8217;s success and
position coming to depend less on family and
station, more on the man himself. Women&#8217;s
economic progress, combined with an increasing
sense in both women and men of the real sacredness
and responsibility of love between the sexes,
is making marriage, in many ways the most vital
of all social relations, a free and joyful bond between
equals, rather than a yoke imposed by
egotism and endured by helplessness. In sum,
the democratic ideal is substituting, in all social
relations, the genuine inner cohesion for the artificial
mortar and cement of external usage. Finally,
it is the same regard for inner realities, so
characteristic of idealism, that is giving to men&#8217;s
religious experience a new profundity. When
once the heart is awakened, it needs no longer
the assurance of antique books that God exists,
and it can worship him no longer as a mere formula,
universal because featureless. Intuition supplants
revelation, and men enter into a personal
relation with the God they had before conceived
as austere, characterless, and remote. Modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
nonconformity is an indication of the reality of
modern religious feeling.</p>

<p>In countless ways we thus discern the working
of the idealistic impulse in our contemporary
life. Independence in personal conduct
and thought, democracy in social relations,
nonconformity in religion, stand out as salient
features of the modern world, especially when
we contrast them with the conventionality,
paternalism, and ecclesiasticism of the mediæval.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks, together with the reflections
they will suggest to the reader, may
perhaps suffice to show that idealism has met at
least one of the requirements of human progress,
by filling the mind with a vastly richer and more
various mass of contents than mysticism admitted.
The realities it takes account of are far
less pathetically inadequate to match the actual
richness of experience than the thin, impalpable,
and austere conceptions of the mystic.
Compared with his, the world of the idealist
is a breathing, moving world, not entirely
void of the infinite tragedy and comedy of life
itself. Something of passion and pathos it has,
and it is held in shape by the tough fibres of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
commonplace&mdash;for even the trivial is not excluded.
All this increase of complexity, however,
would be quite nugatory were a principle
of unity lacking. The complexity must be built
into an order if it is to be truly a synthesis, satisfying
to the mind as well as to the sense of
reality.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, a fact of capital importance,
that idealism does succeed in unifying, as well
as in enriching, our conceptions of life. It systematizes,
at the same time that it broadens, our
views. Much as it insists on the variety of experience,
even more does it assert its organic unity.
Indeed, the central ideal of idealism, its
very heart of hearts, is its belief in the wholeness,
the organized integrity, of the universe.
It respects the body, the mind, and the soul of
man; but even more it respects the whole man,
in just balance and full inward cooperation of
functions. Believing man to be an organism, it
sets supreme store by his full or organic activity,
and deplores undue prominence in any element
of his life, as injuring the harmony of the whole.
Ardently as it champions individual initiative, it
demonstrates, through philosophy, that the very
consciousness of the individual is dependent on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
his social relations.<a name='FNanchor_17_17' id='FNanchor_17_17'></a><a href='#Footnote_17_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> It recognizes that democracy
can exist only through mutual service, and
that freedom is based on a universal sense of responsibility.
It is clearly aware that a personal
relation with God comes only to him who is willing
to obey God, not in a spirit of passive endurance,
but with active joy, as a part serving the
whole in which it has its being. This recognition
of a just relation to the whole as the supreme
ideal of all partial existences is testified
to most strikingly by our very vocabulary, the
natural repository of our beliefs. The word
&#8220;health,&#8221; denoting physical well-being, is derived
from the Anglo-Saxon &#8220;hal,&#8221; or whole;
&#8220;sanity,&#8221; signifying mental well-being, is from
the Latin word for the same idea, &#8220;sanus;&#8221; and
we name the most indispensable of moral traits
&#8220;integrity.&#8221; True idealism is in no way more
certainly to be distinguished from its sentimental
counterfeits than by its constant recognition
that the preservation of the wholeness, as well
as the fullness, of man&#8217;s nature, is the <i lang='la' xml:lang='la'>sine qua
non</i> of human welfare. It values every least manifestation
of his nature, because it considers each
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
one sacred; but it values even more the coordination
and harmony of all.</p>

<p>Turning from the consideration of idealism
in its general effect on modern life to examine
its more special effect upon art, we recognize at
once its importance as an æsthetic force. Art is
the expression of man&#8217;s physical, emotional, and
spiritual life, in organized fullness. Wherever
there is direct, complete, and beautiful expression
of what seems to man precious, there is
art. Wherever, on the contrary, there is suppression
of any genuine human impulse, in
fancied service to some other, as in the case
of mediæval mysticism, there is artistic immaturity
or arrest; and wherever there is an exaggerated
development of any one impulse, at the
expense of others and of the balance or symmetry
of all, as in the cases of modern French realistic
literature and of program music, for example,
there is artistic decadence. And since idealism
insists both on the claims of all legitimate human
impulses to recognition, and on their submission
to adjustment in the interests of a rounded human
nature, idealism is a potent stimulus to true
art.</p>

<p>All this is amply illustrated in that great development
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
of art under the spur of idealism which
we name the Renaissance. By renaissance, or
rebirth, is meant a reawakening of the human
spirit to fuller activity, an increased recognition
of its native dignity and value as transcending
all artificial sanctions and limits. The renaissance
period was, as it were, the adolescence of
humanity. It was the time of putting away
childish things&mdash;passive dependence on authority,
superstition, timorous conventionality&mdash;and
of asserting the freedom and the responsibilities
of men. In the race, as in the individual, it was
primarily an internal event, which reached external
expression only with difficulty and after a
struggle. The youth has his vague internal sense
of the sacredness of his convictions long before
he can work these out into the fabric of actual
life. A long fight with stubborn customs, with
indifferent circumstances, must take place before
ideals can become actualities. Just so, the idealism
of the race had to meet in mortal combat a
thousand opposing conditions, had to conquer
its foes and acquire its ways and means, before
it could victoriously express itself in art. In other
words, feeling had to enter into and transform
technique in order that the art might voice fully
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
the impulse that animated it. When we speak
of the renaissance, therefore, we mean no narrow,
special period of time, precisely dated, like
a battle or a treaty. We mean a new spirit of
liberty and self-respect in the human mind, which
expressed itself in one way at one time, in another
at another, according to the facility and
promptitude with which it acquired mastery over
these ways. The expression followed the effort
only after a long interval, and different expressions
came at different epochs, far apart in time.
In a general way we may say that the Renaissance
has occupied the centuries of our era from
the fourteenth to the one in which we live. But
each art has also had its special period of development,
reaching in its own good time the goal of
its own particular efforts, under the conditions
of its own peculiar medium.</p>

<p>There are as a rule several successive stages
in the evolution an art thus undergoes under the
spur of idealism. First there is the vague inner
sense of a new weight of meaning to be expressed,
fresh insight or intuition that demands
utterance. Men awake to the true value of
those inner impressions and feelings which have
so long been smothered under conventions and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
the worship of the external. They know not
what to do with them, how to voice them; but
they have at least what Stevenson calls &#8220;that
impotent sense of his own value, as of a ship
aground, which is one of the agonies of youth.&#8221;
This may be called the period of the fresh insight.
Then comes the period in which some
sort of technical medium is arduously developed
for the expression of the new impulse. This
period, in which a vast work must be done by
patient experiment, by slow adaptation, without
standards and without models, is necessarily long
and laborious. Often the prompting insight is
almost forgotten in the toil, and the initial passion
seems to be lost in dry formalism and pedantry.
But all the while ways and means are
being invented, problems solved, and traditions
established, even as, while the youth toils at
desk or plough or counter, forgetful, for the
moment, of the ideals that sent him thither,
habits are being formed, mastery is being acquired.
The period of technical equipment, then,
if it be properly conducted, leads over into the
period of achievement, in which the original impulses
are adequately expressed by means of the
acquired skill. This is the time of consummation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
of maturity, of balance between the means
and the ends of expression. Such was the age
of Pericles in Greek sculpture, the age of Sophocles
in Greek drama, the Elizabethan age in
English drama, the age of Leonardo and Michelangelo
in Italian painting, the age of Wordsworth
and Keats in English lyric poetry. Unfortunately,
the period of maturity is generally
followed by still another period, in which the
original impulse overshoots its mark and becomes
embodied in distorted, grotesque, and
unbeautiful forms. So weak is human nature
that it can seldom recognize justly its own value
without going further, without precipitating itself
into the pitfall of over-valuation, pride, and
arrogant self-assertion. The balance of all the
elements of art to which idealism aspires is then
lost; special elements become preponderant,
special effects are made fetishes, and degeneration
ensues. Ripeness leads over into decay;
wholeness or sanity is lost, and partiality paves
the way to disintegration.</p>

<p>Mediæval painting, for example, was exceedingly
rigid, dry, and conventional. The effort
of the ecclesiastical painters was merely to symbolize
religious truths; they were like chroniclers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
who aim at narrating facts, rather than like
ballad-writers and minstrels who are interested
also in the beauty of their language, the richness,
charm, and intrinsic appeal of their images
and phraseology. But by imperceptible degrees,
led on by the natural human delight in shapeliness
of form and luxury of color, and learning
to make the skill acquired in delineation subserve
the higher and more immediate purposes
of art, the painters of the Renaissance gradually
substituted for this merely symbolic treatment
a broader one, in which human beauty was as
much sought as religious edification. The nude
figure was lovingly studied, not because the saints
happened to be men, but because men are beautiful.
Garments, draperies, fabrics received a
new attention, in the interests, not of historical
accuracy, but of the intrinsic pleasantness of textures
and tints. Postures were softened, adjusted,
made less angular and uncompromising than in
the almost chart-like early frescoes. Atmosphere,
chiaroscuro, composition, balance, were
deemed worthy of the efforts of painters who
considered art an end in itself. Eventually, by
the great pictures of the Venetian, Florentine,
and Neapolitan masters, all the human faculties
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
were called into harmonious activity; the eye
was delighted, the feelings were wooed and stimulated,
the imagination was touched and informed.
&#8220;Instead of riveting the fetters of ecclesiastical
authority,&#8221; says J. A. Symonds,<a name='FNanchor_18_18' id='FNanchor_18_18'></a><a href='#Footnote_18_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>
&#8220;instead of enforcing mysticism and asceticism,
[art] really restored to humanity the sense of
its own dignity and beauty, and helped to prove
the untenability of the mediæval standpoint; for
art is essentially and uncontrollably free, and, what
is more, is free precisely in that realm of sensuous
delightfulness from which cloistral religion
turns aside to seek her own ecstatic liberty of
contemplation.&#8221; Whether painting, which thus
by insistence on the intrinsic values of its medium
attained maturity, then carried the process
too far, and lost roundness and balance by prizing
mere richness of color above all else, whether,
in a word, its consummation was followed by a
decadence, is a question too large for discussion
here. But it is beyond doubt that painting went
through the first three phases of growth pointed
out as the results in art of an idealistic impulse.</p>

<p>In the same way, the story of music from the
beginning of the seventeenth century up to Beethoven,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
or throughout that section of its history
in which we are at present interested, was essentially
the story of a renaissance, or novel artistic
development, under the spur of idealism. Looking
at it from the vantage-point now reached,
we easily trace its evolution through the several
regular stages. In the Florentine reformers&#8217;
abandonment of old conventions and their half-conscious
aspiration towards a new utterance,
we discern the first stage of the movement, that
of the novel impulse; in the steadfast and efficient
delving away at technical methods, at
the involutions of harmony, counterpoint, and
form, which characterized many of the later
composers of the seventeenth century, and occupied
much of the attention of even such men
as Haydn and Mozart, we trace the second
stage, that of equipment; and in the glorious
works of Beethoven, who set the keystone in
the arch, we find the stage of consummation and
fulfilment. Springing from the foundation of
the mystical art of Palestrina much as modern
Italian painting sprang from the foundation of
mediæval religious delineation, the art of Pure
Music reached, in the masterpieces of Beethoven,
its maturity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, as we saw in the first chapter, the mature
art of Pure Music, which may be defined
as the art of combining pure tones, without
words, into forms expressive of our fundamental
emotional life, and congruous with
one another, or beautiful, necessarily possesses
three kinds of value, or modes of effect, to
which we have assigned the descriptive labels
&#8220;sensuous,&#8221; &#8220;expressive,&#8221; and &#8220;æsthetic.&#8221;
Music has sensuous value in proportion to
the actual physical gratification afforded us by
the tones that compose it; it has expressive
value proportional to the degree in which it
excites in us, by association and suggestion, the
fundamental emotions or feelings; it has æsthetic
value proportional to its success in assimilating
or organizing all its various effects into
clear unity, thus giving us that sense of ordered
richness which we call beauty. If it be true,
then, that music, during the seventeenth century,
under the spur of the idealistic or modern
spirit, developed from a primitive into a mature
art, it is obvious that this development must
have rested on progress made in all three kinds
of effect; and it becomes a matter of much interest
to trace at least some of the chief phases
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
of this three-fold blossoming. In the remaining
portion of the present chapter, accordingly,
we shall study the most striking features of the
progress made during the seventeenth century
in sensuous charm and in expressive power; and
in the following chapter we shall examine those
principles of pure music which underlie its highest,
most indispensable quality of all&mdash;that of
beauty, or final unity and harmony of impression.</p>

<p>Remarkable, in the first place, is the development
the mere material medium of music underwent
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
The sensuous fact at the bottom of all music
being the tone, the sensuous value of music
depends on the kind of tones employed and on
the modes of their combination, just as the sensuous
value of a painting depends on the purity
and richness of the pigments used and on the
harmoniousness of their arrangement. So long
as composers dealt either with choirs of human
voices alone, or with a few crude instruments
like the organs of Bach&#8217;s predecessors, the violins
of the early sixteenth century, and the spinets
and clavichords of the same period, they could
get little variety or sonority of tonal color. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries was made a wonderful mechanical advance.
The violin, the most important of all
instruments, not only because of its inimitable
beauty and expressiveness of tone but because
it is the nucleus of the orchestra and of the string
quartet, was brought, by the Amatis, Giuseppe
Guarneri, and Antonio Stradivari, the famous
Cremonese violin-makers who flourished from
about 1550 to 1737, to a degree of perfection
which the utmost modern ingenuity has been
unable to exceed. The organ, which in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was so cumbersome
that each key had to be struck by the
entire fist, came by 1600 to something like its
modern condition, as may be seen by looking at
the pieces written for it by Frescobaldi (1583-1644)
and Buxtehude (1637-1707). The prototypes
of the modern piano were rather slower
to develop. At the beginning of the sixteenth
century the clavichord was a smallish oblong
box without legs, placed on a table when played;
its compass was somewhat over four octaves;
one set of strings had to suffice for several keys,
each key being provided with a metal tangent or
tongue that not only sounded the string, but at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
the same time &#8220;stopped&#8221; it at the requisite point
for producing the desired tone. The &#8220;damping&#8221;
or silencing of the strings, entrusted in the
modern piano to the felt dampers, was often
done by the left hand of the player. The spinet
differed from the clavichord in that its tones
were produced by a hard piece of quill that
plucked the string. Both instruments gave but
weak, short, and rather characterless sounds.
But all through the period we are considering
they were being experimented upon and slowly
improved in sonority, variety, and color of
tone.</p>

<p>But even after they are provided with perfected
instruments, men are still much restricted
in their search for lovely effects of tone unless
they have also a well-developed tonal technique,
or science of harmony. The tools are not
enough; the use of them must also be known.
As we have seen, however, the harmony of Palestrina
and his school was for all its purity somewhat
colorless and flat. A harmonic fabric made
up exclusively of consonant chords is like a picture
painted altogether with pure, light colors;
it is wonderfully bright and transparent, but its
very purity makes it lack force. For the sake
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
of contrast an admixture of dissonances is required,
much as shadow is required in a picture,
or harshness and irregularity in a poem. The
entirely sweet, soft, and mellifluous series of
chords at first charms, but finally cloys.</p>

<p>One of the important tasks of seventeenth
century composers, therefore, was to find out
how to introduce dissonances in such a way as
to invigorate without disrupting the fabric. Their
harshness must not be obtruded, but it must be
used. The Florentine reformers and their successors
showed great skill in solving the problem.
They learned how to &#8220;prepare&#8221; a dissonance,
that is, to let one of its constituent tones
appear in a consonance and then hold over while
other voices moved to dissonant intervals; they
experimented in harsher and harsher dissonances,
admitting them only with great circumspection,
but using their characteristic qualities with striking
effect; and they established, as cadences,
conventional formulæ of chords containing dissonant
intervals, which became by mere force of
repetition acceptable and familiar. In this way
they introduced into the material of music a variety
and range of color that consonances alone
could never give. &#8220;Monteverde,&#8221; says Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
R. A. Streatfield, &#8220;with his orchestra of thirty-nine
instruments&mdash;brass, wood and strings complete&mdash;his
rich and brilliant harmony, sounding
so strangely beautiful to ears accustomed
only to the severity of the polyphonic school,
and his delicious and affecting melodies, sometimes
rising almost to the dignity of an Aria,
must have seemed something more than human
to the eager Venetians as they listened for
the first time to music as rich in color as the
gleaming marbles of the Cà d&#8217;Ora or the radiant
canvases of Titian and Giorgione.&#8221; If we
could disabuse our minds of all emotional and
æsthetic perceptions while listening to modern
music, we should still find it vastly superior to
the choral art of the middle ages in its purely
sensuous richness. Sensuously it is a kaleidoscope
of shifting effects, now harsh, now sweet,
now resonant and sibilant, the next moment
infinitely wooing and grateful; and through all
ever changing its outlines and melting from
color to color like the iridescent film of a soap-bubble.</p>

<p>But of course we cannot disabuse our minds
of emotional and æsthetic perceptions; no human
being can divest himself of such essential
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
parts of his nature; and indeed it was even more
in obedience to higher requirements than for
the sake of mere sensuous richness that the
musicians of the renaissance period so radically
remodelled their art. The essence of their reforms
is to be looked for, not in the increase of
the first or sensuous value of music, but in the
enhancement of its expressiveness, and of its
plastic beauty.</p>

<p>Expression, in general, may be defined as the
presentation of a feeling or idea by means of an
impression. The impression may act either directly,
calling up the specific idea or feeling by
virtue of a long-established association between
them, or more generally, by simply inducing a
state of mind congruous with the expression desired,
and so tending to generate it. The former
is the case in verbal expression (language), where
certain definite symbols, words, are immemorially
coupled in our minds with certain ideas,
conceptions, or feelings, so that when we hear
the word we immediately think the thing. Musical
expression differs from verbal expression
in that in does not act by this direct arbitrary
symbolism, but rather by the more subtle general
process which instills a feeling by setting up
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
its appropriate atmosphere or <i lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>milieu</i>. It is much
vaguer and more general, and for that very
reason far more potent. The word &#8220;love,&#8221; for
example, arbitrarily denotes a certain idea, not
because it is anything like the idea, but because
we all agree that that word is to mean that
thing.<a name='FNanchor_19_19' id='FNanchor_19_19'></a><a href='#Footnote_19_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> An amorous piece of music, on the
contrary, utters no definite symbol; it makes
our heart beat faster and deeper, it makes
our blood circulate, it ravishes our senses and
our minds, until whether we will or not we
know what it says, though for our lives we
could not put its burden into words.</p>

<p>It is by this direct establishment in us of a congruous
or favorable state of mind that the consonances
of the mediæval music express religious
peace; and it is no otherwise that dissonance,
that powerful engine of the modern musician,
expresses the inward division, the struggle
and sweet torment, of idealistic states of
feeling. The harshness, disagreeable in itself
but essential to a process in which it is organically
linked with sweetness and rest, arouses by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
an association of ideas a sense of the stern beauty,
the tragic splendor, of the experience of the
human heart. It reproduces in the sphere of
sound that same series of states, that pain merging
into joy, which we recognize in the sphere
of our consciousness as so deeply characteristic
of finite life. And so doing, it suggests or
shadows forth the very essence of our nature,
it echoes the utterance of our very hearts. It is
no expurgated reading of the book of life: it is
the full text, with all its shuddering horror and
all its celestial joy.</p>

<p>Probably of all the employers of dissonance
for the purpose of emotional expression, in the
whole course of the seventeenth century, when
the aims of musicians were so tentative that it
required courage to brave convention, the most
daring was Claudio Monteverde. &#8220;As Monteverde
most frankly of all musicians of his time,&#8221;
writes Sir Hubert Parry,<a name='FNanchor_20_20' id='FNanchor_20_20'></a><a href='#Footnote_20_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> &#8220;regarded music as
an art of expression, and discords as the most
poignant means of representing human feeling,
he very soon began to rouse the ire of those
who were not prepared to sacrifice the teaching
of centuries and their own feeling of what really
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
was artistic without protest. That he should
presume to write such simple things as ninths
and sevenths without duly sounding them first
as concordant notes<a name='FNanchor_21_21' id='FNanchor_21_21'></a><a href='#Footnote_21_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> was so completely at variance
with the whole intention of their art that
it struck them with consternation. And well it
might, for small as these first steps were they
presaged the inevitable end of the placid devotional
music. The suddenness of the poignancy
which unprepared discords conveyed to the
mind implied a quality of passionate feeling
which musicians had never hitherto regarded as
within the legitimate scope of musical art. They
had never hitherto even looked through the
door which opened upon the domains of human
passion. Once it was opened, the subjective
art of the church school, and the submissive
devotionalism of the church composers, was
bound to come rapidly to an end. Men tasted
of the tree of knowledge, and the paradise of
innocence was thenceforth forbidden them.
Monteverde was the man who first tasted and
gave his fellow men to eat of the fruit; and from
the accounts given of the effect it produced upon
them they ate with avidity and craved for more.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>[110]</a></span></p>
<p>Parry gives in illustration of Monteverde&#8217;s style
a fragment known as &#8220;Ariadne&#8217;s Lament,&#8221; from
the opera &#8220;Arianna,&#8221; so characteristic that it
must be reprinted here:</p>

<p>In studying this remarkable fragment, the
reader will not only note the striking unprepared
dissonances of measures 2, 5, 11 and 13
(the latter peculiarly poignant), but if he will
take the trouble to compare the effect of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
passage as a whole with that of the bit of Palestrina
given in Fig. III., he will be amazed at
the increase in expressiveness, especially if it be
remembered that &#8220;Arianna&#8221; was produced
probably in 1607, or only thirteen years after
Palestrina&#8217;s death. The &#8220;Lament&#8221; is reported
to have moved everyone who heard it to tears.
Its pathos is largely due to the skilful way in
which harsh dissonances are made to alternate
with the consonances into which they naturally
and inevitably lead&mdash;a process which, though
not directly expressive of the facts of human
emotion, in the sense in which the word is directly
symbolic of the thing which usage has
coupled with it, is yet indirectly and generally
expressive, in that it reproduces in tones a series
of impressions identical with the series of feelings
we everywhere experience in actual life.
Pain linked to pleasure by an organic bond&mdash;that
is the universal experience of everyone who
cherishes an ideal, since an ideal is a yearning
for something which now is not, but which must
eventually come to be.</p>

<p>The melodic character of the &#8220;Lament&#8221; is
as impressive as its harmonic style. In its short
and poignant phrases the accent of passion is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
unmistakably heard. And this is true not only
of Monteverde&#8217;s work as a whole, but of that
of all the other composers of the Florentine
&#8220;new music.&#8221; As early as the year 1600 Jacopo
Peri wrote an opera on the subject of Euridice,
to be performed at the wedding of Henry IV
of France to Maria Medici. A study of the
passages in which he tried to express the grief
of Orpheus at the loss of Euridice, and his joy
in their reunion, brings home forcibly to the
mind the advance that composers had even at
that time made in eloquence of expression.
They are as follows:</p>

<p>In spite of the primitiveness of the style,
there is considerable force and even definiteness
of expression here. As Sir Hubert Parry points
out: &#8220;the phrases which express bereavement
and sorrow are tortuous, irregular, spasmodic&mdash;broken
with catching breath and wailing accent;
whereas the expression of joy is flowing, easy
and continuous.&#8221; It was in fact the aim of the
inventors of the type of operatic recitative here
exemplified, to imitate, while idealizing, the actual
cadence of the voice in emotional speech.
The music of the choral epoch had carefully
avoided the impression of passionate feeling;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
the new music as persistently sought it. The
old music had been written for chorus, which
by mere virtue of numbers is quite impersonal;
the new was put into the mouths of individuals.
The melodic style of the former was dignified,
formal, severe; that of the latter was mobile,
flexible, constantly adaptable to the most subtle
changes of mood. Here again, then, we see the
effect of the idealistic impulse on music. Idealism,
insisting on the worth of finite experience,
focusses man&#8217;s attention on himself, on his actual
feelings, petty as well as universal, base and
noble alike, and makes him, whether for good
or evil, vividly self-conscious. It believes in
the hopes and fears, the aspirations and disappointments,
of men and women; believes that
in human beings, in spite of their pathetic weakness,
there is a unique original value, not to be
denied without crippling that august whole of
which they are the minute but essential parts.
The music of Peri, Caccini, and Cavaliere, and
later of Monteverde, succeeded in voicing, at
first dimly but with increasing eloquence, the
primitive human emotions that mysticism had
disdained as worldly; the tendency they initiated
gathered force apace, and passed with Cavalli
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
and Lulli into France, where it culminated
in the work of Gluck. The great contribution
of early modern opera to pure music was the
accent of genuine and various human feeling.</p>

<p>A third tendency toward distinctively modern
methods that was steadily gaining ground
throughout this period was the tendency toward
metrical and rhythmic vigor. We have seen
how vigorous meter, in music, serves to express
our active impulses, how it grows out of that
ordered gesticulation we name dance.<a name='FNanchor_22_22' id='FNanchor_22_22'></a><a href='#Footnote_22_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> We
have seen how devoid was the mediæval choral
music of meter,<a name='FNanchor_23_23' id='FNanchor_23_23'></a><a href='#Footnote_23_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> and indeed how inappropriate
to its peculiar genius metrical qualities would
have been.<a name='FNanchor_24_24' id='FNanchor_24_24'></a><a href='#Footnote_24_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a> The moment men&#8217;s attitude toward
their own ordinary activities changed, however,
and they began to see in them life rather
than death, their expression in art became a desideratum.
And it is a fact that very early in
the sixteenth century, even before the pure
choral music had reached its perfect maturity,
some composers had begun to write simple
dances for unaccompanied instruments, generally
a combination of strings with harpsichord.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>[118]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long while these efforts remained tentative
and inchoate, because the men who made
them were neither very clearly aware what they
were trying to do, nor acquainted with technical
means for doing it. But the scheme of treating
dances as the basis of instrumental movements,
the chief expression of which was that of
energy, vitality, the more active and effervescent
emotions, was afterwards elaborated by
more trained masters, and eventually bore fruit
in the innumerable suites and partitas, or bundles
of dances, of the eighteenth century, and
in the symphonic minuet and scherzo.</p>

<p>The mere fact that composers of the seventeenth
century paid respectful attention to the
popular minstrelsy, which had been treated with
such scant courtesy by ecclesiastical masters,
and that they so persistently imitated its methods,
is in itself strong testimony to the change
of attitude that was taking place. The songs
and dances of the people are the most spontaneous
expressions of purely personal feeling in
the entire range of music. They were upwellings
of primitive emotion, as instinctive and
unsophisticated as the cries and gestures from
which they were developed. And for these
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
reasons they were norms of the proper expression
of naïve feeling in music&mdash;all music, so
far as it aims to express personal feeling at all,
makes use of the melodic phrases derived from
the cry, and of the dance-rhythms derived from
the gesture. Consequently, so soon as musical
artists became inspired with the new ideal of
personal expression, they turned to the popular
music for inspiration and methods.</p>

<p>Thus in all ways the tendency of music in
the seventeenth century was toward a fuller,
more varied, and more poignant emotional expressiveness.
Men were willing to forego without
a murmur all the advantages of the perfected
technique of the earlier choral age, and
to trust themselves on the pathless sea of the
New Music, because, like the pilgrims who in
the same century left European civilization behind
them to seek a larger if more difficult life
in an uncharted country, they were inspired by
a love of the human spirit in its fullness and
freedom. All arbitrary limitations and denials
of it, no matter how hallowed by long usage,
were to them not religious, but sacrilegious.
To them, as to Terence, &#8220;nothing human was
alien&#8221;; and they might have cried, with Whitman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
to every human trait, however trivial, ignoble,
or commonplace, &#8220;Not till the sun excludes
you do I exclude you.&#8221;</p>

<p>We need not wonder that for a while they
paused helpless before the task of assimilating
into an order all these rich materials that their
humanism had evoked out of chaos. At first
they were more discoverers than artists. But
genuine progress, as we say, takes place only
when a richer variety is stamped with a broader
but still obvious unity. Art is not merely expression,
of howsoever varied and penetrative a
quality; it is congruous, harmonious expression,
delighting us not only mediately by
what it says, but immediately by what it is. In
other words, it rises from the plane of interest
to the plane of beauty, and becomes genuine art,
only by the possession of that third or æsthetic
value which depends on the ultimate unity of all
the various factors of effect. This highest value
music came, in the course of time, to possess;
and the conquest of new forms, intrinsically
beautiful, in which all the novel sensuous and
expressive effects could be embodied, was of all
the achievements of the seventeenth century the
most important.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>[121]</a></span></p>

<p>It remains, therefore, to study, in another
chapter, the means by which musicians learned,
after long trial and patient experiment, to give
shape and integral life to all this motley array
of feelings and effects that they had summoned
out of the depths of the human spirit.
Their task, as may easily be believed, was an arduous
one. We need not follow all the steps
they took on that long road. It will suffice to
examine some of the more important stages of
their progress, to get before our minds the
general artistic principles which underlay their
practices, and to see what point they had
reached by the time Haydn, the first great forerunner
of Beethoven, came to take his share in
their great enterprise.

<p class='p4 center'>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE PRINCIPLES OF PURE
MUSIC</p>


<p>Just as success in the intellectual
and moral worlds results from
power to shape ideas and conduct,
to make syntheses which
combine the most various elements
in unity, so artistic success results from
the power to shape into a single organism the
various elements of artistic effect. Art may
make a deep appeal to us by the richness of its
sensuous charm, and a still deeper by the eloquence
of its emotional expression; the deepest of
all appeals it will not make, we have asserted,
unless, by marshalling its materials into an obvious
order, it adds to its sensuous and expressive
charms the æsthetic charm, the greatest of
all&mdash;beauty. Art, we hinted, was beautiful in
the proportion of its unified variety; and we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
set ourselves to see what methods men gradually
worked out, in the seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries, by which the wonderfully
various effects of their new music could be
stamped with final unity.</p>

<p>In the fact that they attain beauty through
the presentation of variety in unity, all the arts
are alike; yet they differ much in the way they
accomplish this end, because of their differing
conditions. Those arts, notably sculpture,
painting, and architecture, which adjust their
materials in space, necessarily use methods
quite different from those of the temporal arts
of literature and music, which, existing solely
in time, have no spatial relations of any sort.
The spatial arts, presenting all their elements
simultaneously, differentiate and at the same
time interlink them by means of relative position,
size, and prominence. In a well designed
figure or group of figures, in sculpture, there is
always a balance of masses, by which the whole
work, however diverse in detail, is knit into
unity. The centre of gravity is kept well in
toward the centre of the entire mass; all the
features at the extreme edges lead the eye back
to the middle to rest; there is centralization of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
effect, balance, poise. In a good picture, all
spots of high light, all prominent lines, all
striking lineaments of every sort, are similarly
contrived to equalize the tensions of the eye,
to keep it in that state of attentive rest, or anchored
discursiveness, which is so indescribably
delightful. The same is true of all well-proportioned
buildings and other architectural
monuments. Activity of eye and mind are
stimulated, but also governed and directed.
Howsoever the eye, in looking at any good
picture, statue or piece of architecture, may
quest and rove, it is constantly brought, by the
gentle power of good design, back to the centre
of rest; the sense of interesting variety is
always wedded with the sense of ultimate completeness
and repose.</p>

<p>In the temporal arts of literature and music
the same effect is gained by quite different
means. Here the elements are not presented
simultaneously, spread out for the attention to
wander from and revert to at will. Each is
presented but for a moment, after which it
exists only in the memory. Nevertheless all
literature and music worthy the name of art give
us, in common with the spatial arts, the sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
of symmetrical shape, of ordered profusion.
Though we are aware of each single lineament
but for an instant, after which it is supplanted
by the next, yet we know that all combine into
just as complete and satisfying a scheme as that
of the well-designed statuary group, the well-composed
picture, or the well-proportioned
building. This consciousness of form or design
in a series of momentary impressions, on which
all the high æsthetic value of the temporal arts
depends, is made possible to us by our mental
powers of memory and recognition. Literature
and music deal with memorable units,
which are repeated. Familiarity with their
methods quickly accustoms us to expect the
repetitions; whereupon there arises a succession
of expectations, followed by their fulfilments,
by which the so fleeting impressions are arranged
in our minds in a fixed and satisfying
order. And so arises the sense of beauty in
the contemplation of a poem or a piece of
music.</p>

<p>In poetry two different modes of repetition
are utilized, each arousing its own peculiar expectation,
which combines with its fulfilment to
give the sense of order. The first mode is that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
of metrical repetition, the establishment and
reiteration of a certain scheme of accentuation
of syllables practically equal in duration. In
heroic verse, for example, the scheme is a succession
of ten syllables, every alternate one
accented, and beginning with an unaccented.
When a single line of this sort is heard, it forms
a pattern in the mind, and arouses an expectation
of another of the same sort. The fulfilment
of the expectation gives rise to the sense
of form. In rhymed verse, a second kind of
repetition is added to this fundamental metrical
one, namely, the repetition of the terminal sound
of the line. When we read &#8220;&#8217;Tis not enough
no harshness gives offence,&#8221; the obviously regular
character of it in respect of accent leads us
to expect very confidently another line of the
same metrical structure; and our familiarity
with rhyme disposes us to think it highly
probable that the new line will moreover end
with a sound similar to the final one in &#8220;offence;&#8221;
so that when the line comes&mdash;&#8220;The sound must
seem an echo to the sense,&#8221;&mdash;it fulfils both of
our expectations, and we get a double sense
of design in it. The rhythm, or reiteration of
the metrical scheme, is supplemented by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
rhyme, or repetition of the terminal sound.
In the more complex forms of verse the two
schemes of design not only become far more
subtle in their single application, but are made
to cooperate and reinforce each other in all sorts
of ingenious ways. The couplet, the ordinary
quatrain, the Omar Khayyam quatrain, <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>terza
rima</i>, the rondeau, the rondel, the triolet, and
all the stanza forms, are simply different
schemes of combining rhythm and rhyme, the
two fundamental formative devices of all
poetry.</p>

<p>Like poetry, music welds its elements by
means of two modes of arousing and fulfilling
our expectations; but these, though they are
somewhat analogous to poetic rhythm and
rhyme, are so much less close to our ordinary
experience that they will need a slightly more
detailed explanation.</p>

<p>All modern music is divided up into beats,
or equal time divisions, arranged into groups
or measures by some regular system of accentuation.
The accented beats, like the accented
syllables in verse, impress the mind as goals of
movement, in reference to which the light beats
are felt as transitions or preparations. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
regularity of the alternation of transition and
goal is such that the mind quickly forms the
habit of expecting each goal beforehand, and
of taking a proportionate satisfaction in it when
it arrives. This process of expectation and
fulfillment links the successive beats together
in an organism, which we may call the musical
foot, after its analogy with the poetic foot.<a name='FNanchor_25_25' id='FNanchor_25_25'></a><a href='#Footnote_25_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> So
limited is the mental span that it is practically
impossible for us to group more than three
beats together in this way into a single organism;
and all music consequently consists of
combinations of either duple feet (one light
beat followed by a heavy), or triple feet (two
lights followed by a heavy) or complex arrangements
of both sorts together. After this fundamental
grouping of the time-elements is
made, the mind instantly proceeds to recombine
the groups into larger groups called phrases
or sections. This it does by the same device
of accentuation, either actual or ideal. It conceives
one measure or foot as heavier or more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
significant than another, and so leaves one as a
transition, to approach another as a goal. Thus
groups of simple elements become themselves
the compound elements of a larger synthesis,
and the entire musical fabric gains definiteness
and organization through the process of aroused
and fulfilled expectation. Any metrical formula,
like that of a bugle call, interrupted at any
note before the last, gives us as vivid a sense
of incompleteness as a statue with arms and
legs broken off, or a ruined building, or a mutilated
picture.</p>

<p>Metrical structure in music is thus, obviously
enough, fairly analogous with metrical structure
in verse, with its grouping of syllables into feet,
of feet into verses, and of verses into couplets
or stanzas. When we pass to the second sort
of musical structure, however, which we may
call tonal or harmonic structure, the parallel
analogy with poetic rhyme is much less satisfactory.
It is true that harmony and rhyme
both act by presenting similar sounds at given
points in the series of impressions; but harmony
is a far more subtle, various, and potent
organizing agent than rhyme. Harmony depends
on the fact that the tones, or pitch
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
elements, used in music, can be distinguished
into unrestful and restful, or into transitional
and final, just as the metrical or time-elements
are. In primitive music, in which but one tone
sounded at a time, the matter was almost absurdly
simple: high notes were unrestful,
because they involved muscular tension;<a name='FNanchor_26_26' id='FNanchor_26_26'></a><a href='#Footnote_26_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> low
notes were restful, because they meant relaxation
of vocal effort. Consequently, a descent
of the voice meant a transition to a goal, and
songs were divided off into sections by successive
falls of the voice or cadences. The word
&#8220;cadence,&#8221; so important in musical terminology,
preserves in itself the record of this phase of
musical growth; from the Latin <i lang='la' xml:lang='la'>cado</i>, to fall, it
means primarily a sinking or lapsing, and
hence, in general, a coming to rest.</p>

<p>As soon as two or more melodies were sounded
together, however, the sense of rest following activity,
the universal generator of design in a temporal
series of impressions, could be produced in
a far more subtle way. It could be produced by
making the melodies pass through an inharmonious
or dissonant chord or series of chords,
to a harmonious one. As soon as dissonance
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
came into general use, in other words, the
sense of unrest, of impulsion toward something
else, of progressive movement, that it imparted
to music, was so potent that cadences could be
made upward as well as downward; whenever
dissonance resolved into consonance the effect
of cadence ensued. And as dissonances are of
all conceivable degrees of harshness, cadences
could be made of any desired degree of finality.
Moreover, as the tonal material of music grew
more and more systematized, the feeling of key
sprang up in men&#8217;s minds; all music was felt to
be in a certain key, that is, grouped about a
certain tone, the centre and goal of all the
others; and then cadences came to have even
greater variety in the degree of finality they
seemed to assert, dependent not only on the
strength of the dissonances they followed, but
also on the remoteness or nearness of their final
chord to the key-note of the piece. All this
meant greater and greater resources for building
up music into complex and yet perfectly
definite organisms; and as harmonic form constantly
interacted more and more subtly with
metrical form the capacities of design became
practically infinite.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Lest the reader get lost in the maze of technical
details, however, it will be well now to
revert to the general principles underlying all
these musical phenomena, and to sum up,
before passing on, the essential points we have
been trying to come at. Those arts which,
like poetry and music, present their matter to
us in a temporal series, depend for that organization
of variety into unity which is beauty
(and the <i lang='la' xml:lang='la'>sine qua non</i> of all art) on the arousal
in us of expectations, which are presently fulfilled.
By first leading us to expect something,
and then presenting it, they enable us to group
our impressions, to feel that they are interrelated
and mutually dependent, to get, in short,
the sense of design or order. Music effects
this by means of metrical and harmonic form,
which act is the same way so far as they present
unrestful, followed by restful, impressions,
though in different ways so far as the technical
basis of these impressions is concerned. Psychologically
speaking, metrical and harmonic form
cooperate to give music definite structure in
our minds; to reclaim it from the condition of a
mere sensuous or emotional stimulus, and engraft
upon it the final and supreme beauty of order.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>[136]</a></span></p>

<p>All absolute or pure music depends for its
structure on these two great formative agents
of metrical and harmonic design; but the mode
of their application progressed from simplicity
to comparative complexity as music evolved
from the choral song of the sixteenth century,
out of which it grew, to the modern sonata and
symphony. It would be quite impossible to
examine in detail, here, all the stages of that
progress. Our effort must be rather to define
three well-marked phases of the many-sided
growth in general and summary terms, taking
for granted, meanwhile, the minor variations
and modifications which elude our somewhat
rough analysis. These three phases have in
common certain essential traits. In each we
see music making up its elementary units of
effect, out of unorganized tones, by the aid of
metrical and harmonic form; in each we see it
combining these units into complex designs by
means of the principles of variated repetition of
them. The difference between the phases is
that in the later ones the units are larger and
more definite, and are combined into broader,
more complex organisms.</p>

<p>The first phase is that in which short musical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
&#8220;subjects,&#8221; called motifs, are made the
elements of contrapuntal forms such as the
canon, free prelude, invention, madrigal, and
fugue. This phase, in which pure music
makes its first appearance, emerging from the
choral music which needed no musical principles
of design because it took its shape and
meaning from words, grew naturally out of the
choral music which preceded it. Imagine any
bit of melody springing into existence in connection
with a verbal phrase or sentence; then
fancy it sounded without the words which gave it
reason for being: it is easy to see that the only
way it can now be given significance is by being
made the subject of a <em>musical</em> design, that is, by
being repeated, either literally or in modified
form. Even the most primitive savages have
always felt this. In Sir Hubert Parry&#8217;s book
on &#8220;The Evolution of the Art of Music&#8221; we
find many examples of formulas of notes used
by savages as motifs, and developed simply by
endless repetition. Such formulas as the following,
for example, become, by mere repetition,
true music of a primitive type:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>[138]</a></span></p>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE VI. FROM PARRY&#8217;S &#8220;EVOLUTION OF THE ART OF MUSIC,&#8221; p. 49.</div>
</div>

<p>The earliest attempts at pure music, though
infinitely more advanced than these childish
forms, were, like them, built up out of short
motifs, of anywhere from two to a dozen tones,
given definiteness by fixed metrical and harmonic
relationships, and developed by means
of repetition. All through the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries such contrapuntal forms
were being developed to a high pitch of perfection,
and they reached their culmination in
the great fugues of J. S. Bach (1685-1750).
Let us, then, instead of poring painfully over
the obscure steps by which this vantage-point
in art was reached, make a brief analysis of
the consummated fugue-form, as it was treated
by this supreme master.</p>

<p>The fugue of Bach, as it is represented, for
example, in the forty-eight fugues of his &#8220;Well-Tempered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
Clavichord,&#8221; is a contrapuntal or
polyphonic form; that is, it is made up of from
two to five voices or parts, progressing with
complete melodic independence of one another,
yet in entire harmony. It is based on, or proceeds
out of, a short motif or subject, often but
a measure or two in length, but subjected to
the most ingenious, varied, and exhaustive
manipulation. It has certain structural divisions,
and always ends in the key in which it
began; yet its form does not, strictly speaking,
depend on its sectional structure, as is the case
with the song, dance, and sonata forms, but
rather on the logical exploitation of the motif.
The motif, in a word, is the primary fact of
the fugue, the seed from which is germinated all
the luxuriant florescent life of the subsequent
music.</p>

<p>Since the motif is the animating force of
the entire fugue, it is obvious that upon its
pointedness, variety, and interest will depend
the vitality of the composition as a whole.
Bach accordingly spares no pains in the construction
of his motifs. Much as they differ
in length, expression, and style, all are brimful
of interest. Each embodies some striking
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
musical idea; some persuasive or emphatic
rhythm, some definite tonal design which either
by its oddness or by its utter naturalness and
inevitability lays firm hold upon the attention
at once, and coerces interest whenever it recurs.
Here are a few motifs from the &#8220;Well-Tempered
Clavichord&#8221;:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag140.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 530px;'>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE VII.</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The variety is wonderful, even in these five
subjects; and it will be seen at once how provocative
of musical thought they are, like condensed
aphorisms, packed with suggestions that
send the mind questing through endless vistas
of imagination.</p>

<p>As for the further treatment of the fugal
motif, the actual formal rules, despite the awe
they have immemorially aroused in the popular
mind, are few and simple. After the first
announcement of the subject by a single voice,
it is answered by a second voice, at an interval
of a fifth above;<a name='FNanchor_27_27' id='FNanchor_27_27'></a><a href='#Footnote_27_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> then again stated by a third
voice, and answered by a fourth. This process
goes on until each voice has had a chance
to enunciate the motif, after which the conversation
goes on more freely; the subject is announced
in divers keys, by divers voices; episodes,
in a congruous style, vary the monotony;
at last the subject is emphatically asserted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
by the various voices in quick succession
(&#8220;stretto&#8221;) and with some little display or
grandiloquence the piece comes to an end.
But simple as is this scheme, it gives the composer
ample opportunity to develop his theme
with the utmost ingenuity, to subject it to the
most surprising metamorphoses, and to place
it in ever new lights and postures.</p>


<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score1_pag142.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE VIII.</div>
</div>

<p>Practically all the possibilities of developing
a motif were exploited by Bach in his marvelous
fugues. The development of the motif
means, in the most general terms, the repetition
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
of it in forms sufficiently like the original
one to be recognizable, yet sufficiently unlike
it to be novel and interesting, to exhibit it, as
has just been said, in &#8220;new lights and postures.&#8221;
Now, since the identity of the motif
depends on the fixed metrical and harmonic
relations of its constituent tones, it is obvious
that variation of it will have to consist in
slight alterations of these metrical or of these
harmonic relations, or of both, managed with
such skill that they do in effect vary, without
disintegrating, the motif. Our next task, then,
will be to describe the chief means, both metrical
and harmonic, by which the motif, in the
hands of Bach and of all his successors, is
modified without being destroyed.</p>

<p>Mere repetition, of course, is not, strictly
speaking, development, however efficient it may
be as a means of building up musical structures.
With the repetition of the motif at a different
place in the scale, however, such as is used in
the &#8220;answer,&#8221; we have a true development,
though an elementary one. Here all the metrical
and harmonic relations of the motif are
kept intact, at the same time that the bodily
shifting of it in the scale throws upon it, so to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
speak, a new light. This will be felt at once
by any musical person who will play over attentively
the two subjects and answers of Figure
VIII. A much more radical change is
effected when the motif is changed from major
to minor, or vice versa, or presented in some
key other than the dominant and more remote,
or presented with new harmonization. Still,
even in such cases, the metrical and fundamental
harmonic form of the subject remains unaltered.</p>

<p>In the device called &#8220;inversion,&#8221; much used
by Bach, we have an essential change. The
metrical form of the subject, remaining unchanged,
ensures recognizability, but the harmonic
relations, while remaining identical in
respect of size, are exactly reversed in respect
of direction; in other words, the subject is
turned upside down. A few examples will explain
this better than many words.</p>

</div>

<p>Many other examples might be given, for
Bach is endlessly ingenious in his use of inversion,
and all the composers who followed him
have used it. Its effect, as will be seen from
the examples, is most stimulating; the mind
easily perceives the likeness to the original subject,
since the rhythm is retained intact; yet the
turning upside down of all the pitch relations
produces most unexpected and interesting features.</p>

<p>So much for modifications dependent on
altered tonal relationships. Those produced
by metrical alterations are if anything even
more serviceable to the composer. The simplest
metrical change possible is produced by
increasing or decreasing the actual duration of
all the tones in the motif, while retaining jealously
their proportionate duration. Thus the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
identity of the motif is not tampered with, but
it is made to bear a new relation to its musical
context. This device is named augmentation
or diminution, according as the time-values of
the motif are augmented or diminished.</p>

<p>It will be well worth the reader&#8217;s while to play
through the entire fugues cited, noting the marvelous
skill and subtlety with which Bach
weaves his fabric.</p>

<p>In augmentation and diminution the original
accents of the motif are for the most part retained&mdash;it
is only the durations that are altered.
More transformative still, therefore, are those
devices which actually shift the accents of the
motif, its most salient and identifying features.
The most important of these, which we may call
&#8220;shifted rhythm,&#8221; is seldom found in Bach;
for its frequent and exhaustive application we
must look to Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms.
As its name indicates, &#8220;shifted rhythm&#8221; consists
in bodily shifting or transposing the motif
in such a manner that its heavy beats become
light, and its light ones heavy. In order to

<p>The foregoing discussion and examples will
serve to give a slight idea of the wonderfully
varied means of manipulating short motifs or
musical subjects which composers derive from
the peculiarities of metrical and harmonic organization.
These means were utilized by Bach
in the fugue with tireless industry and inexhaustible
imagination. The fugue became in
his hands the most perfect in its orderly complexity
of all the forms of pure music; for sheer
intellectual interest of a highly abstract kind his
fugues have never been surpassed. Nor are
they, as those unfamiliar with their intricacies
are apt to suppose, devoid of emotional expression.
The profundity, poignancy, and variety
of the feeling they express are as marvelous as
their consummate beauty of structure. They
voice every mood, from the most earnest and
impassioned gravity to the lightest banter. They
are the first great independent monuments of
pure music; and wherever future musicians may
wander in the quest of new forms and new
potencies of expression, Bach&#8217;s fugues will always
stand magnificent on the horizon, marking

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>[150]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, nevertheless, not only that the
fugue form makes the severest demands on the
attention and intelligence of the listener, but
also that, because of its ecclesiastical origin and
polyphonic style, it is incapable of the kind of
highly personal, secular expression that it was
in the spirit of the seventeenth century to demand.
The prototypes of secular expression
are the popular dance and song, and as soon as
learned musicians had discovered means to give
to dance and song movements the completeness,
breadth, and organic coherence requisite to large
beauty, they began to turn their attention away
from the austere if noble contrapuntal forms,
and to base their art on more popular models.
The result was that even in the age of Bach the
suite of dance and song movements began to
be cultivated almost as sedulously as the fugue,
and Bach himself wrote suites which in their
way are quite as good as his more polyphonic
works. The second great phase in the application
to pure music of the principles of metrical
and harmonic design is represented by the Suite.</p>

<p>As practiced by Bach, the suite is a series of
dances and songs, written in a style partly polyphonic
and partly monodic (that is, consisting
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
of a single melody with subsidiary accompaniment).
His introductory movements, allemandes
in the French suites, preludes in the
English, are stately or energetic contrapuntal
pieces, intended to commence the suite with an
impression of dignity. They are followed by
courantes, bourrées, sarabandes, minuets, airs,
and gavottes, all more or less definitely rhythmical
and animated; and the concluding movement
is generally a rollicking gigue. These
suites of Bach may be considered perfect models
of the form.</p>

<p>Now, when we contrast the suite with the
fugue, the first difference that strikes us is that
while the fugue, of polyphonic and ecclesiastical
origin, is not definitely rhythmical, but proceeds
somewhat amblingly and without division into
segments of definite duration, the suite movements,
owing their origin as they do either to
songs intended to be sung to verses of equal
length, or to dances intended to accompany
symmetrical motions of the body, are markedly
rhythmical&mdash;are made up, in fact, of phrases of
equal length, balancing one another and giving
an impression of complete symmetry. A fugue
proceeds like a prose sentence; a gavotte or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
bourrée or a minuet sounds more like a stanza
of verses. In short, the fundamental element
in a dance or song is not a fragmentary motif,
but a complete phrase, filling, as a rule, two
measures, though sometimes four, eight, or even
three or five. The phrase begins with a motif,
but fills it out with additional matter rounded
off by some kind of cadence. That the phrase
is thus a more complex and extended unit than
the motif, a few examples from Bach will make
clear.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that in each case the
second phrase answers or supplements the first.
Like it in length and in general contour, it is
at the same time more positive and final, so
that the combined effect of the two is much like
that of a couplet of verses. The first phrase,
in fact, arouses in our minds an expectation,
which only the second can satisfy; so that we
have here a new and larger application of the
now familiar device for binding together successive
impressions. So characteristic is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
supplementation of one phrase by another that
theorists have adopted a set terminology suggested
by it, calling the first phrase in all such
cases the &#8220;antecedent phrase,&#8221; and the second
the &#8220;consequent phrase.&#8221; It will also be
noted, however, that the pair of phrases, once
heard, becomes itself a unit in the mind, and
arouses a new expectation of further matter to
establish a still larger balance; and a reference
to the pieces of Bach cited will show that Bach
in each case follows up his pair of two-measure
phrases by a four-measure phrase which supplements
them as they supplemented each other.
And so the process goes on, the piece growing
ever larger and more complex by a regular
accretion, until at last a phrase of definite and
entire finality is reached, and the movement
stands complete. All short songs and dances
illustrate this progressive accretion of phrases
into larger and larger units, by means of a constant
unfolding of new expectations and fulfilments.
To trace it out, to analyse what the composer
has so ingeniously built up, is one of the
most fascinating of studies; for it shows us how
the simplest song is organic like a crystal, a
flower, or an animal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>[155]</a></span></p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable to lay
down here any rigid rules as to the metrical or
harmonic relationships between the phrases.
Generally, the metrical balance is fairly simple;
a two-measure phrase is usually answered by
another of the same length; two such phrases
are often answered by a single four-measure
phrase. But sometimes four measures are answered
by two; and not infrequently three- or
five-measure phrases appear unexpectedly but
with quite satisfactory effect. The sense of
balance must be given&mdash;that is all we can say:
just how it shall be given will depend, as Mr.
Weller would say, &#8220;on the taste and fancy of the
composer.&#8221; As for the harmonic relationships,
endless variety is possible. Yet we may here
point out certain general principles. Every
phrase, as we have seen, ends with some sort of
a cadence, strong or weak according to the harshness
of the dissonance it contains and the nearness
of its final chord to the tonal centre, or
key-note, of the piece. Now, as the salient
tones of any key are its tonic and its dominant,
the most obvious and natural course for the
composer is to embody these in the successive
phrases; and as the tonic conveys the impression
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
of finality it is natural to use that last.
A glance at Figure XII will show that Bach
makes his antecedent phrase, in the first instance,
end with a tonic chord, but a weak one; in the
second instance, with a dominant. In both
cases the consequent phrase ends with a strong
tonic. Thus the harmonic as well as the metrical
relations produce the effect of expectation
and fulfilment, of antithesis between a transitive
and a final impression. This is the general
principle of all harmonic structure. The final
impression is given by a strong tonic chord;
the mediate impression, arousing the sense of
anticipation, is given by some weaker and contrasting
harmony, in the vast majority of cases
the dominant chord. A full sense of the inexhaustible
capabilities of this sort of harmonic
structure can be gained only by a careful analysis
of many pieces such as the movements of
Bach&#8217;s suites. To this the reader is recommended.</p>

<p>When once composers had grasped the possibilities
of structure by means of harmony,
they quickly proceeded to work them out in
the large, as applied to a complete musical form.
They began to organize whole pieces by means
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
of a grouping or ordered antithesis of different
harmonic centres. Working without models
and in the dark, they made many false starts
and wrong moves, they tried many hybrid and
unstable forms; but eventually, in the course of
years of experiment, they developed two great
types of structure, based on fundamental principles,
and embodied, with unimportant minor
modifications, in almost all the suite-movements
of the seventeenth and of later centuries. The
first of these two great general types of structure,
called Binary Form, contained two distinct
members or sections; the second, called Ternary
Form, contained three sections.</p>

<p>The essential principle of binary form is the
simplest conceivable. Every piece in binary
form may be likened to a journey to a neighboring
place, followed by a return home. &#8220;The
King of France, with forty thousand men,
marched up the hill, and then marched down
again.&#8221; In the case of binary form, the king of
France is the subject or theme of the piece;
the forty thousand men are the variations or
developments on this subject that are worked
out as the piece proceeds; the hill is the progress
from the tonic key to the contrasted tonal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
centre, generally the dominant, or, if the piece
is in a minor key, its relative major; and the
march down again is the return to the home
key. More specifically, the first section begins
with the announcement of the theme in the
tonic key, and proceeds to ring changes upon
it, meanwhile modulating to the contrasted key
and ending with a firm and memorable cadence
there. At this point the second section begins,
with the theme as at first, but in the new instead
of the original key; the modulation is reversed,
the original key re-entered, and the same cadence
already heard repeated, but now even more
firmly, and with the added finality of the home
key. The device is simplicity itself, yet it admits
a surprising variety of detail within its
perfectly obvious and satisfying unity of ultimate
effect. Most of Bach&#8217;s allemandes, courantes,
airs, sarabandes, and gigues, are executed
in binary form.</p>

<p>The great disadvantage of this admirably
concise and organic structure proved in the
course of experience to be a certain monotony
and rigidity. As movements became longer
and more complex, the division into two sections,
embodying but two keys in spite of momentary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
excursions to more remote centres,
came to seem rather constricting. There was
a dearth of variety about it, and a tendency to
obviousness. The element of contrast, of adventure
far afield, was somewhat lacking.
Composers accordingly worked out, of course
unconsciously, a more various but equally organic
scheme of design&mdash;ternary form. In
ternary form the first section is practically identical
with that of binary form; but the second,
instead of &#8220;marching down again,&#8221; makes the
contrasting tonal centre it has reached but a
starting-point for still further excursions. It
modulates freely, using to the utmost the privilege
of admission to all the keys of the gamut
that music owes to Bach and his system of equal
temperament; it plays with the theme, subjecting
it to the modes of development we have
already studied; it indulges in all sorts of pranks
and whimsies, departing as much as possible from
the set formality of the first section; in a word,
it endeavors to establish a complete contrast with
what has gone before, and while never violating
logic, to get away as far as possible from the
beaten track, from the rut of routine. Then,
after this interregnum of variety, comes the third
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
section with an emphatic reassertion of regularity,
presenting once more the subject as at
first, and in the tonic key, vindicating the unity
of the movement of the whole, and rounding
it out to orderly completeness. Splendid examples
of this splendidly organic structure are most
of the preludes, gavottes, bourrées, and minuets
of Bach&#8217;s suites.</p>

<p>In the suite, then, as it was practiced by Bach
and other seventeenth-century composers, we
see operative a constantly broadening application
of the use of expectation and fulfilment, in
the interests of organic structure. Applying
to artistic music those methods of metrical and
harmonic form that had long determined the
growth of folk-song and dance, the composers
of this period gradually learned to make even
wider and more intricate syntheses of their materials.
So skilfully did they avail themselves
of the relations between contrasting harmonic
centres that they were able eventually to write
whole movements as firmly organic, as deftly
coordinated, as a vertebrate animal. By the
ever-extending use of thematic variation and of
free modulation, they made their pieces as various
as they were systematic. And at last, in ternary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
form, they established that succession of statement,
contrast, and reassertion, which seems
even to-day the last word in the philosophy of
general musical structure.</p>

<p>The gradual expansion and increase of complexity
in the movements of the suite, made not
only possible but logically necessary by the
structural potencies of these great principles of
statement, contrast, and reassertion, and of antithesis
of keys, led eventually to a new phase
of musical structure, the third and last in the
evolution we have been tracing. The suite, in
the seventeenth century the most successfully
cultivated of all the forms of pure music, gave
place in the eighteenth century to a still higher
form, the sonata, which has held the position of
supremacy ever since. The sonata form is, not
only by tradition but by natural right, the norm
of modern musical structure. Almost all the
chief works of all the great composers from
Haydn and Mozart to Brahms and Tschaïkowsky
are cast in this mould, as we easily realize
if we remember that not only those pieces specifically
named &#8220;sonatas,&#8221; but also trios, quartets,
quintets, and the like, and overtures and
concertos and symphonies, are but pieces in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
sonata-form intended for various groups of instruments.
The string quartet is a sonata for
two violins, a viola, and a 'cello; the concerto
is a sonata for solo instrument with orchestral
accompaniment; and the symphony is a sonata
on a large scale, for orchestra. This remarkable
prevalence of a single type of structure in
modern music means far more than the accidental
survival, by inertia, of an artificial convention;
it means that this type of structure is
on the whole the best possible embodiment of
variety and unity in tonal effects; that it is the
natural outgrowth of more primitive forms; and
that it is elastic enough to admit into its uniform
scheme of order the most diverse expressions
of individual temperaments and ideals.
Tschaïkowsky&#8217;s intuition of beauty in tones is
different enough from Haydn&#8217;s; and the formal
medium of which both can avail themselves
without violence to their genius must obviously
be founded deep in universal human psychology.</p>

<p>The modern sonata consists, as a rule, of four
movements, contrasted in character and in key,
but combining to form a rational and complete
whole. In expression, the movements conform
deftly to the natural requirements of human
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
nature. The first is energetic, vigorous, and
complex. The second is sentimental, melancholy,
noble, or profound. The third affords
relief from the emotional concentration of the
second; it is a dance, full of vivacity, humor,
fantasy, and whimsical impulse; with Beethoven
it becomes a consummate embodiment
of the spirit of comedy, which is quite as
essential a part of human nature as that of
tragedy and earnest emotion. The fourth and
last movement is again vigorous and dashing,
but in a less intellectual way than the first;
it ends the whole composition in a mood of
simple and happy animation. As regards structure,
moreover, the movements differ in conformity
with the needs of the situation. The
first, which is to be heard when the mind is
most attentive and unfatigued, is by far the
most complex,&mdash;is indeed often the only one in
what is technically called &#8220;sonata-form.&#8221; The
second, the interest of which is more emotional
than intellectual, is usually of fairly primitive
structure. The third, a dance, is in the simplest
of ternary dance-forms, that of the minuet, and,
as written by Haydn and Mozart, might almost
be taken bodily out of a suite. The final movement
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>[164]</a></span>
is also usually of simple, obvious structure.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that of all the movements of
the sonata, the minuet is the nearest, in structure,
to those more primitive types embodied in
the suite.<a name='FNanchor_28_28' id='FNanchor_28_28'></a><a href='#Footnote_28_28' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> It makes a link bridging the gap
between the older form and its more highly-developed
supplanter. A glance at its construction
will show how near it is to those simple
ternary forms already described in connection
with the suite. The symphonic minuet of
Haydn is built up out of phrases, welded together
in the manner now so familiar to us.</p>

</div>

<p>But there is a considerable increase in the subtlety
with which the phrases are combined, in
the &#8220;modelling,&#8221; so to speak, of the melody.
Greater variety is perceptible, the balance of the
phrases is less obvious, while equally satisfactory.
The structure, in the more extended
sense, is ternary.<a name='FNanchor_29_29' id='FNanchor_29_29'></a><a href='#Footnote_29_29' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a> The first section of Haydn&#8217;s
Minuet, just cited, ends, after eighteen measures,
in the dominant key. The second section,
or section of contrast, contains some passages
that are markedly different from the original
theme, though congruous with it, and modulates
so far afield as E-flat major (the home key
being G). After twenty-two measures of this
digression, the section of reassertion enters with
the original theme in the tonic key, lasts twenty-two
measures, and ends strongly in the home
key. The minuet proper, as with Bach, is followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
by a similar short piece, called the trio,
put in for the sake of contrast. After it the
minuet recurs; and it is an interesting fact that
the whole movement is thus a large example of
the same device of statement, contrast, and reassertion
that is exemplified in its parts. In
other words, the whole minuet is a &#8220;statement,&#8221;
the whole trio a &#8220;contrast,&#8221; and the repeated
minuet a &#8220;reassertion.&#8221; We see here, then, the
fundamental form which we described as ternary,
and which may be symbolised by the letters A
B A, utilized as a structural agent both in the
individual parts, and in the whole of the movement.
The symphonic minuet is quite obviously
the child of the suite minuet, but a child approaching
maturity, becoming complex and intricate
in coordination.</p>

<p>The form generally adopted for the last movement
of sonatas exemplifies a different way of
utilizing the same general principles of design.
As its name of &#8220;rondo&#8221; implies, it consists of
a constant recurrence or &#8220;coming around&#8221; of
the main thematic idea, which, as before, we may
call A; but with several contrasting sections,
instead of only one. The rondo type of structure
may be symbolized by the letters A B A C A D A,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
etc. It embodies, obviously enough, a greater
variety than the simpler dance form out of which
it grew, and at the same time preserves unity by
the repetition of the main theme. It is less perfectly
coordinated, however, than the minuet;
for as each episode occurs but once there is a
deficiency of logic and of artistic economy; and
as the principle of the form is sectional there is
no intrinsic reason why it should not be prolonged
indefinitely. It is, therefore, an essentially
imperfect and indeterminate organism, although
it is serviceable enough as the mould of
a movement in which gaiety and general animation
are more important than highly articulated
plastic beauty.</p>

<p>The slow movement is of all the parts of the
sonata the least uniform in structure. Often it
is written in the primitive aria-form, identical
with the minuet form; sometimes it is an adaptation
of rondo form to the exigencies of deliberate
movement and emotional eloquence; and not
infrequently it is a modification of &#8220;first movement
form,&#8221; or sonata form proper. Its value
depends but little on its structure, and almost
entirely on its expressive qualities.</p>

<p>Of all the movements of the sonata, as has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
already been said, the first, which comes when
the listener is fresh and disposed to give minute
and unflagging attention, is the most complex.
First movement form, however, is but a further
application of the simple principles of statement,
contrast, and reassertion, and of contrast of keys,
that are already operative, in an easily understood
way, in the minuet, the aria, and the rondo. The
first movement of a regular sonata begins with a
first subject, or theme, in the tonic key, built, of
course, upon a striking, individual, and memorable
motif. After this has been well impressed
upon the mind by a certain amount of repetition,
either literal or modified, there is a formal transition
to a contrasted key, generally the dominant,
or, if the movement be in minor, the relative
major, and a second subject enters, is in its turn
well impressed upon the attention, and ends with
an emphatic cadence or close in the contrasted
key. This much makes up one complete section
of the form. Historically, it is an outgrowth
of the first part of an ordinary small
ternary form, by simple magnification of the
elements, and increasing definition of and contrast
between them. What was at first but an
inconspicuous modulation becomes a formal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
transition; and what was but a cadence in the
contrasting key becomes a new subject, with its
own individuality and function in the organism.
And thus is built up the section of statement,
with quite a high degree of complexity of its
own. This is sometimes called the Exposition.</p>

<p>Next comes the &#8220;Free Fantasia&#8221; or &#8220;Working
Out,&#8221; the section of contrast, derived from
the similar section in the minuet, but far longer
and more intricate. In material it is a development,
or manipulation, of the thematic germs
stated in the exposition, by aid of all the devices
for developing motifs that we have traced.
Structurally, its function is to establish complete
contrast, to do away with the impression of rigid
system that the first section is likely to engender,
and in every possible way to give variety,
surprise, and interest to the musical tissue. It
is accordingly absolutely free in modulation, unsystematic
in arrangement, and irregular in
metrical division. In it the composer gives rein
to his fancy, obeys the impulse of the moment,
and lets his ingenuity rather than his shaping
instinct determine his progress. Yet the section
of contrast is not a mere limbo of chaotic impulses.
It must have its own logic, it must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
a true &#8220;development,&#8221; it must be throughout
obviously founded on the themes already stated.
There is no part of the sonata-form in which all
the composer&#8217;s strength is more taxed than the
Free Fantasia; here, indeed, freedom brings its
own heavy responsibility.</p>

<p>After the contrast comes the reassertion, or
&#8220;Reprise.&#8221; Having displayed his materials in
every light his imagination can suggest, and
having meanwhile almost obliterated his hearer&#8217;s
sense of the key of the piece, the composer now
carefully prepares to gather up all his flying
threads, to stamp all this baffling variety with
ultimate unity. Re-entering the home key, which
has gained by its long silence a new power to
delight and satisfy, he restates his two subjects
or themes, in their original guise, but now both
in the home key. As the essayist, after all his
examples and figures and metaphors, returns to
a bald, emphatic, final assertion of his thesis,
the composer now, after all his playing with his
ideas, reinstates them in more than their primitive
simplicity.<a name='FNanchor_30_30' id='FNanchor_30_30'></a><a href='#Footnote_30_30' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a> To give them perfect finality
he even reiterates them with fresh assertiveness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
seems unwilling to leave them, and insists, in his
Coda or tail-piece, that we take away with us a
full sense of their import. Thus restatement,
emphatic and prolonged, following upon contrast
and digression, completes the unity of the whole
composition, and closes the cycle to our satisfaction.
It is impossible to conceive a type of
musical structure which should better satisfy our
demand for profusion of detail together with
clarity of fundamental shape, than this highly perfected
product of a long evolution, sonata-form.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that this wonderful
scheme of design reached its maturity in any
short period of time, or through the labors of a
few musicians. Infinitely slow and gradual was
its growth; and though the immediate followers
of J. S. Bach, and especially his own son, Philip
Emmanuel Bach, brought it to a condition in
which its general outline was pretty well established,
it was still, at the time when Haydn appeared
on the scene, incapable of that free manipulation
which high musical beauty requires.
It was Haydn who removed the last traces of
stiffness and primitive angularity from the sonata-form;
it was Haydn who brought it to complete
definiteness as an artistic device and stamped it
with lasting individuality; and it was Haydn
who at least hinted and foreshadowed those
subtleties and accommodations in its treatment
which, as extended by Mozart and Beethoven,
perfected its capabilities and brought it to its
mature estate as the most vital, elastic and beautiful
of modern musical forms.</p>

of contrast effects. After the subject is announced in the tonic,

<p class='p4 center'>CHAPTER V<br />
HAYDN</p>


<p>In the early eighteenth century
there lived in a small village
called Rohrau, situated near the
Leitha River, which forms the
boundary between Lower Austria
and Hungary, a certain wheelwright and
parish sexton, named Matthias Haydn, and his
wife. They were simple peasant people, a little
more educated than was usual with their class.
Matthias Haydn, besides a smattering of general
information, had a talent for harp-playing,
though he could not read music. Frau Haydn&#8217;s
accomplishments ran in the direction of domestic
management and religion; and as she eventually
found herself the mother of twelve children,
she may be supposed to have stood in
need of both. Franz Joseph Haydn, born
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
either on March 31 or April 1, 1732, was the
second of these children. He was destined to
create an epoch in the art of music.</p>

<p>How, in spite of his rather commonplace
parentage and his heavy burden of poverty, he
managed to develop so remarkable an artistic
genius, has been a problem most puzzling to
students; but much light has been thrown upon
the whole matter by the recent investigations
of a Croatian scholar, Dr. Frantis&#780;ek S&#780;. Kuhac&#780;,
made accessible to readers of English by Mr.
W. H. Hadow&#8217;s &#8220;A Croatian Composer.&#8221;
These researches have shown that the whole
region about Rohrau was inhabited by a largely
Croatian or South Slavonic population; that
Haydn himself was probably of Croatian heredity;
and that at the very least his youth was
spent among one of the most naturally musical
of all races. &#8220;One in every three of the
Croats,&#8221; says Dr. Kuhac&#780;, &#8220;either sings, plays,
or composes.&#8221; &#8220;The men sing at their plows,&#8221;
says Mr. Hadow, &#8220;the girls sing as they fill
their water-pots at the fountain; by every village
inn you may hear the jingle of the tambura,
and watch the dancers footing it on the
green.&#8221; Here, then, was an environment precisely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
suited to develop the qualities we shall
observe in the mature Haydn; and it helps to
an understanding of almost every phase of his
genius if we remember that as a boy he was
surrounded, not by stolid German peasants,
amiable but inexpressive, nor by a cultivated
but unspontaneous aristocracy, but by a race
of natural musicians, in whom dance and song
were native and necessary modes of expression.</p>

<p>His formal musical education was less propitious.
At the age of six he began the study
of the violin, the harpsichord, and singing, under
one Frankh, a distant relative, in the town
of Hamburg; but was so neglected and abused
that in later years he was wont to say: &#8220;From
Frankh I got more cuffs than gingerbread.&#8221;
He was probably glad enough when, two years
later, he was able to go to Vienna as a choirboy
in St. Stephen&#8217;s Cathedral. Here he stayed
ten years, half-starved, insufficiently clothed,
and carelessly taught. Only his own indomitable
energy enabled him to learn anything at
all. He worked while the other choir-boys
were at play; he practiced indefatigably on his
little clavier, which was so small and light that
he could take it under his arm to a quiet place;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
he covered reams of music paper with his compositions,
thinking that &#8220;it must be all right if
the paper was nice and full;&#8221; he expended six
of his father&#8217;s hard-earned florins on ponderous
text books of counterpoint and thoroughbass,
and spent wakeful nights poring over them.
Meanwhile his relations with the musical director
in authority became more and more strained,
until finally, in November, 1749, there was
open rupture, and Haydn, seventeen years old,
friendless, and without money, was turned into
the street.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the hardships
he now had to endure. By playing his
violin at balls and weddings, by making arrangements
of the compositions of amateurs for a
pittance, by teaching&mdash;in a word, by any drudgery
that anyone would pay for, he managed to
keep himself from starving. And through it
all, in his dimly-lighted, unheated attic, with
roof so out of repair that snow and rain fell on
the bed, and the water, of a winter morning,
froze in the pitcher, he continued, as best he
could, his own studies in composition. Years
afterward he wrote of this period of his life,
with his usual quaint piety: &#8220;I was forced for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
eight whole years to gain a scanty livelihood
by giving lessons; many a genius is ruined by
this miserable mode of earning daily bread, as
it leaves no time for study. I could never have
accomplished even what I did if, in my zeal for
composition, I had not pursued my studies
through the night.... I offer up to Almighty
God all eulogiums, for to Him alone do I owe
them. My sole wish is neither to offend against
my neighbor nor my gracious Prince, but above
all our merciful God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Haydn had at this time to endure
humiliations and slights as well as actual want,
his situation was gradually ameliorated by the
patronage of some wealthy music-lovers with
whom his growing reputation as a composer
brought him acquainted. His first fixed post
was that of music-director to a Bohemian nobleman,
Count Morzin, for whose band he wrote,
in 1759, his first symphony. In the next year,
however, Count Morzin married and discontinued
his musical establishment, and Haydn
was left for a short time without definite work,
until in 1761 he was installed in the post he
held uninterruptedly for thirty years. His own
marriage, meanwhile, took place in 1760.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>[180]</a></span></p>

<p>How Haydn, who was quite as prudent as
he was amiable, could have been so rash as to
marry at just this moment, it is difficult to explain;
especially as he married, not the woman
he had fallen in love with, but her elder sister.
The whole affair is almost farcically perverse.
A young composer of twenty-eight, just
pulling himself up at length on the shelving
bank of patronage, out of the slough of miscellaneous
drudgery in which he has been weltering
for years, offers to encumber himself at the
critical moment with the daughter of one Keller,
a barber. The lady, for unknown reasons,
among which may or may not have been a dread
of the quagmire, betakes herself to a nunnery.
Whereupon the barber persuades the composer
to marry the older daughter, Anna Maria.
The outcome of this marriage, which took place
in November, 1760, proved, as might have been
expected, unfortunate. The wife began almost
immediately to treat her husband with indifference
and petty malignity, which rapidly increased.
She seemed not to care whether he
composed or cobbled, so long as he supplied
her with money; she used his manuscripts for
curling-papers; when he was in London in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
1791 she wrote him appeals for money wherewith
to buy &#8220;a widow&#8217;s home.&#8221; Altogether
the uncongeniality was intolerable, and the pair
lived together but a few years, although Frau
Haydn did not die until 1800.</p>

<p>The thirty years from 1761 to 1791, a period
of the utmost importance in the development of
Haydn&#8217;s genius, was of the greatest monotony
so far as events are concerned. His post was
that of musical director or Kapellmeister (at first
Vice-Kapellmeister), to the great, princely family
of Esterhazy, one of the most wealthy and influential
of the noble families of Hungary. He
served them both at Eisenstadt, at the foot of the
Leitha mountains, in Hungary, where Prince
Paul Anton Esterhazy was the reigning prince
in 1761, and at Esterhaz, the magnificent palace,
with groves, grottoes, hot-houses, deer-parks,
and flower gardens, which Prince Nicholas erected
in 1766. Of the musician&#8217;s duties and social status
in this princely house, an idea may be gathered
from the following sentences from the contract
entered into at the beginning of his term of service
as Vice-Kapellmeister:</p>

<p>&#8220;The said Joseph Hayden shall be considered
and treated as a member of the household. Therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
his Serene Highness is graciously pleased to
place confidence in his conducting himself as becomes
an honourable official of a princely house.
He must be temperate, not showing himself overbearing
towards his musicians, but mild and lenient,
straightforward and composed. It is especially
to be observed that when the orchestra
shall be summoned to perform before company,
the said Joseph Hayden shall take care that he
and all members of his orchestra do follow the
instructions given, and appear in white stockings,
white linen, powdered, and either with a pig-tail
or a tie-wig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeing that the other musicians are referred
for directions to the said Vice-Kapellmeister,
therefore he should take the more care to conduct
himself in an exemplary manner, abstaining
from undue familiarity, and from vulgarity
in eating, drinking and conversation, not dispensing
with the respect due to him, but acting uprightly
and influencing his subordinates to preserve
such harmony as is becoming in them,
remembering how displeasing the consequences
of any discord or dispute would be to his Serene
Highness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The said Vice-Kapellmeister shall be under
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
an obligation to compose such music as his Serene
Highness may command, and to retain it
for the absolute use of his Highness, and not
to compose anything for any other person
without the knowledge and permission of his
Highness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The said Vice-Kapellmeister shall take careful
charge of all music and musical instruments,
and shall be responsible for any injury that may
occur to them from carelessness or neglect.&#8221;</p>

<p>The demands made upon &#8220;the said Joseph
Hayden&#8221; were obviously severe; but he had
in return many advantages. He was secure from
want, a great consideration to one who had
starved in garrets and sung in the streets and the
cafés for his supper. He came in contact with
many interesting people, both among the social
and the professional guests of Esterhaz. Above
all, he had a good orchestra at his command, and
he was not only privileged, but obliged, to compose
for it incessantly. Thus he was incited to
constant study and experiment; so that before
many years had elapsed he had become a thorough
master of his medium, with the requisite
technical skill to express any idea that his genius
might suggest. It was largely during these years
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
that he poured out his endless series of masterpieces
of chamber and orchestral music.</p>

<p>One result of all the work thus accomplished
was that when, late in 1790, Prince Anton Esterhazy
dismissed his entire corps of musicians,
Haydn&#8217;s reputation was so widespread that he
was immediately solicited by one Salomon, a
violinist and conductor, to make a trip to London.
Hard as it must have been for him, at his
age of nearly sixty, to exchange his studious habits
for the fatigues and excitement of travel, the
opportunity was too good to be lost; and late
in 1790 he set out with Salomon, reaching London
early in the next year.</p>

<p>In reading of this visit to England, as well as
of the second one which Haydn made three
years later, one hardly knows whether to be more
impressed by the fame and prosperity which
came to him from all sides, or by the homely simplicity
with which he received them. This quiet,
precise, pious old kapellmeister was the object
of the most flattering attentions from everyone in
London; he was half worshipped by the ladies,
he was fêted by noble families, he was the guest
of the Prince of Wales. His works were awaited
with impatience and received with enthusiasm;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
he was honored with the Degree of Doctor of
Music by Oxford University; his pockets were
filled with enough English gold to buy him German
soup for the rest of his life. Yet he was
almost as much overwhelmed as delighted with
all this unwonted excitement. With a characteristic
mixture of homeliness and piety he wrote
to his friend Frau von Genzinger: &#8220;Oh! how
often do I long to be beside you at the piano,
even for a quarter of an hour, and then to have
some good German soup. But we cannot have
everything in this world. May God only vouchsafe
to grant me the health that I have hitherto
enjoyed, and may I preserve it by good conduct
and out of gratitude to the Almighty!&#8221;</p>

<p>His English note-book reveals the same childlike
attitude, mingled with an interest in details
and statistics curiously characteristic of his matter-of-fact
mind. Here are a few typical entries:</p>

<p>&#8220;The national debt of England is estimated
to be over two hundred millions. Once it was
calculated that if it were desired to pay the debt
in silver, the wagons that would bring it, close
together, would reach from London to York
(two hundred miles), each wagon carrying
£6,000.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The city of London consumes annually
800,000 cartloads of coal. Each cart holds
thirteen bags, each bag two Metzen. Most of
the coal comes from Newcastle. Often 200
vessels laden with coal arrive at the same time.
A cartload costs 2-1/2 pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beginning of May, 1792, Lord Barrymore
gave a ball that cost 5,000 guineas. He paid
1,000 guineas for 1,000 peaches; 2,000 baskets
of gooseberries cost 5 shillings apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 14th of December I dined at the
house of Mr. Shaw. While I was bowing all
round I suddenly perceived that the lady of the
house, besides her daughters and the other ladies,
wore on their head-dresses a pearl-colored
band, of three fingers breadth, embroidered in
gold with the name of Haydn, and Mr. Shaw
wore the name on the two ends of his collar in
the finest steel beads. N. B.&mdash;Mr. Shaw wanted
me to give him a souvenir, and I gave him a
tobacco-box which I had just bought for a
guinea. He gave me his in exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last sentence is particularly delicious for
its revelation of Haydn&#8217;s usual canniness. Not
even his enjoyment of fame could make him
forget that the tobacco-box given away had cost
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
him a guinea; but he is solaced by the thought
that he had got another in return. One is reminded
of the same trait in reading his comment
on the high prices of race-horses:</p>

<p>&#8220;These horses are very dear. Prince Wallis
a few years ago paid 8 thousand pounds for one,
and sold it again for 6 thousand pounds. But
at the first race he won with it 50,000 pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire diary exhibits a similar thriftiness,
shrewdness, and practicality; by impressing
the reader with the curiously prosaic and
matter-of-fact quality of Haydn&#8217;s mind, it
throws as much light on the essential character
of his music as on that of his personality. Fancy
Beethoven, or any other speculative, imaginative
mind, going to see Dr. Herschel&#8217;s great
telescope, looking through it at the stars, and
then carefully recording in his journal: &#8220;It is
forty feet long and five feet in diameter&#8221;!</p>

<p>One of the interesting revelations made by
Haydn&#8217;s note-book is that of his sentimental
attachment to a certain Mistress Shroeter. It
is a charming and in a way a pathetic story;
the beginning formal, the continuation touchingly
human in spite of the old-fashioned
phrases in which it reaches us, and the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
mysterious. Mistress Shroeter, a widow, relict
of a German musician, begins it in the following
note, copied out carefully, together with all
the subsequent ones, by Haydn:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Shroeter presents her compliments to
Mr. Haydn, and informs him she is just returned
to town and will be very happy to see
him whenever it is convenient to him to give
her a lesson. James St., Buckingham Gate,
Wednesday, June the 29th, 1791.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lessons thus begun continued all through
the period of the composer&#8217;s first London visit,
and the correspondence soon begins to reveal
a growing attachment between the lonely, unhappily
married Haydn and, in his own simple
words, &#8220;the English widow in London who
loved me.&#8221; The letters, quaint, formal, tender,
are couched in the vocabulary of &#8220;Evelina&#8221; and
&#8220;Clarissa Harlowe;&#8221; their &#8220;fair author,&#8221; as one
feels impelled to call her, might have been, with
her funny little abbreviations, her odd admixture
of grandiloquence and impulsive feeling,
and her constant underscoring of unimportant
words, Clarissa herself. A note of April 12,
1792, will perhaps sufficiently show her way of
writing:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;M. D. [My dear.] I am so <em>truly anxious</em>
about <em>you</em>. I must write to beg to know <em>how
you do</em>? I was very sorry I <em>had</em> not the pleasure
of Seeing you this Evening, my thoughts
have been <em>constantly</em> with you and indeed my
D. L. [dear love], no words can express half
the tenderness and <em>affection I feel for you</em>. I
thought you seemed out of spirits this morning.
I wish I could always remove every trouble
from your mind, be assured my D: I partake
with the most perfect sympathy in <em>all your sensations</em>
and my regard for you is <em>Stronger every
day</em>. My best wishes attend you and I am ever
my D. H. [dear Haydn] most sincerely your
Faithful, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus tenderly and innocently the friendship
progresses, with constant protestations of regard,
with continual solicitude to know &#8220;<em>how
you do</em>&#8221; and &#8220;whether you have <em>Slept well</em>,&#8221;
with little discreet panegyrics over &#8220;your sweet
compositions and your excellent performance,&#8221;
and with many fears &#8220;lest you fatigue yourself
with such close application&#8221;; until, with Haydn&#8217;s
departure for home, it suddenly and abruptly
closes, never to be resumed. Did these two
meet again when Haydn returned to London
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>[190]</a></span>
in 1794? Did the letters recommence? We
do not know. The story ends with a letter of
Mistress Shroeter&#8217;s, written just before Haydn&#8217;s
departure in 1792, beginning with the hope that
he has &#8220;Slept well,&#8221; and ending with a protestation
of &#8220;inviolable attachment.&#8221;</p>

<p>After his second trip to London was over,
Haydn returned to Austria, dividing his time
between Vienna and Esterhaz, where he was
again made music-director. Getting now to be
an old man, he lived quietly, making few public
appearances. He composed at this time his
famous Austrian National Hymn, as well as
his two oratorios, &#8220;The Creation&#8221; and &#8220;The
Seasons,&#8221; produced respectively in 1798 and
in 1801. In 1803 he made his final appearance
as a conductor, and in 1808 he appeared
in public for the last time. The occasion was
a performance of &#8220;The Creation.&#8221; &#8220;All the
great artists of Vienna were present,&#8221; says Mr.
Hadden, &#8220;among them Beethoven and Hummel.
Prince Esterhazy had sent his carriage
to bring the veteran to the hall, and as he was
being conveyed in an arm-chair to a place
among the princes and nobles, the whole audience
rose to their feet in testimony of their regard.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
It was a cold night, and ladies sitting
near swathed him in their costly wraps and lace
shawls. The concert began, and the audience
was hushed to silence. When that magnificent
passage was reached, &#8216;And there was light,&#8217;
they burst into loud applause, and Haydn,
overcome with excitement, exclaimed: &#8216;Not I,
but a Power from above created that.&#8217; The
performance went on, but it proved too much
for the old man, and friends arranged to take
him home at the end of the first part. As he
was being carried out, some of the highest in
the land crowded round to take what was felt
to be a last farewell; and Beethoven bent down
and fervently kissed his hand and forehead.
Having reached the door, Haydn asked his
bearers to pause and turn him towards the orchestra.
Then, lifting his hand, as if in the
act of blessing, he was borne out into the
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near the end of May, 1809, Haydn began
to fail rapidly. On the twenty-sixth, gathering
his household and having himself carried to the
piano, he played over three times his &#8220;Emperor&#8217;s
Hymn,&#8221; with great emotion. Five days
later he died. The curious admixture of kindliness
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
and practical good sense which give to
Haydn&#8217;s character such an individual charm appear
even in his will, a long and detailed document
very precisely drawn up. He bequeaths
&#8220;To poor blind Adam in Eisenstadt, 24 florins&#8221;;
&#8220;To my gracious Prince, my gold Parisian
medal and the letter that accompanied it,
with a humble request to grant them a place in
the museum at Forchtenstein&#8221;; &#8220;To Fräulein
Bucholz, 100 florins. Inasmuch as in my youth
her grandfather lent me 150 florins when I greatly
needed them, which, however, I repaid fifty years
ago.&#8221; After many other bequests he concludes;
&#8220;I commend my soul to my all-merciful Creator;
my body I wish to be interred, according
to the Roman Catholic forms, in consecrated
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>In personal appearance Haydn was an odd
mixture of the ordinary and the unusual, of commonplaceness
and distinction. The complexion,
marked with small-pox, was so dark that he was
sometimes called &#8220;The Moor&#8221;; the nose was
strong but heavy; the lower lip thick and projecting;
the jowl square and massive. Yet his
dark gray eyes were said to &#8220;beam with benevolence,&#8221;
and Lavater, the great physiognomist,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
perceived in his eyes and nose &#8220;something out
of the common,&#8221; while dismissing the mouth and
chin as Philistine. Of himself Haydn said: &#8220;Anyone
can see by the look of me that I am a good-matured
sort of fellow&#8221;; yet he confessed that
the ladies, who generally found him interesting,
were &#8220;at any rate not tempted by my beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The explanation of these apparent contradictions
is to be found in the peculiar make-up of
that individuality of which the external appearance
was an index. That mixture of heavy jowl
and penetrative eyes bespoke the combination
of a certain rudeness, primitiveness, commonplaceness
of emotional nature, with rare intellectual
vivacity and acumen. We have already remarked
the prosaic attitude of Haydn towards
men and things, as well as the purely intellectual
alertness with which he observed them. His
vision of the world was more that of an accountant
or statistician than that of a poet. He saw
simply and clearly; for him objects stood in the
hard light of reason, not surrounded by any haze
of reverie or atmosphere of emotion. His mental
efficiency is especially striking when we consider
the natural disadvantages under which it
labored. Haydn was distinctly an uneducated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
man. The son of a wheelwright, in a petty Austrian
village, he had little schooling, little early
contact with men and women, little commerce
with all the indefinable influences that make for
cultivation of the rarer powers of intellect and
spirit. He knew Italian and a little French, but
never had any English until he went to London
at nearly sixty. He read little, and did not care
to discuss politics, science, or any art but music.
He spoke always in the strong dialect of his native
place. Yet by force of sheer intelligence
and ability he established the art of music on a
new basis. Those penetrating gray eyes saw
much that was hidden from men far more happily
born, far more delicately nurtured.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the impressive peculiarity
of his emotional nature is its normality. Emotionally
he was typical rather than personal, centred
in the common interests and instincts rather
than eccentric to them, conservative and conventional
rather than radical and individual. This
is doubtless the meaning of that somewhat stolid
jaw, that firm and vigorous, but rather insensitive
mouth, that sane but unimaginative configuration
of the whole lower face, the expressive
seat of the will and the feelings. Beethoven is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
interesting largely for his departure from the average
human norm, his highly developed selfhood,
his inexorable individuality; Haydn, on
the contrary, compels our study just because he
is so like other men, so amply representative of
them within their own limitations. The traits
that stand out in him are traits &#8220;in widest commonalty
spread&#8221;; a brisk and busy vivacity, finding
itself much at home in this world, with plenty
to do and to inquire into; connected with that,
a half-childlike shrewdness in affairs, a canny
ability to take care of himself, practical talent,
worldly skill; on a higher plane, a sunny kindliness
and good cheer that make him one of the
most genial of men, a kind of simple human
warmth and happiness and joy; finally, on the
highest plane of all, though but a projection of
the human cheer, an ardent piety, a wholehearted
faith in God, an earnest and yet quite
simple religious devotion. These are traits not
exclusively Haydnish, so to speak, as mystical
devotion and resolute idealism are Beethovenish,
but common to all humanity.</p>

<p>Now, these two fundamental qualities of
Haydn&#8217;s nature as a man, his emotional normality
and his mental efficiency, deserve the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
especial attention we have been giving them,
not only on account of their intrinsic human
interest, but also because they determined the
quality of his work as a musician. His wide
sympathy with ordinary men, his practical sense
and shrewdness, his brisk good cheer, his childlike
and wholly unmetaphysical piety&mdash;all these
traits made his music, in its expressive aspect,
far more catholic, far more universal, than the
austere and ethereal music of mysticism. At the
same time, his practical and systematic mind
took firm grasp upon these novel elements of
expression, and wrought them into a clear and
easily comprehensible scheme. He stamped
the naïve and fragmentary utterances of folk-feeling
with the careful, purposeful orderliness
of art; and by so doing, launched music upon
a new period of development.</p>

<p>In both his great tasks, the secularization of
expression and the systematization of form,
Haydn&#8217;s personal faculties were reinforced by
the general musical conditions of his time. At
the end of the eighteenth century the mystical
type of expression in music had not only arrived
at its acme in Palestrina&#8217;s work, after
which it must inevitably decline, but it had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
ceased to be an adequate reflection of the general
human attitude toward life. Men had
turned away from contemplating the mysteries
of divinity, to interest themselves more than
ever before in the commonest feelings, the universal
experiences, of ordinary human beings.
They had discovered the miraculousness of the
commonplace, and learned to respect themselves.
And they had consequently begun to prize as
genuine self-expressions those upwellings of
naïve emotion, the songs and dances of the people,
which had been so long contemptuously
ignored by academic musicians. These folk-songs
had none of the limitations of the more
dignified, recognized art, which paid the price of
its dignity in a sacrifice of fullness of expression.
They voiced not only what was edifying, what
was devout and mystical and other-worldly.
They palpitated with simple human feeling,
very much of this world; they were tender,
animated, melancholy, languorous, excited,
merry, amorous, even trivial, dull, or indecent
at times, as human beings are. They were in
fact the crude but genuine expression of that
full, simple, unrestricted humanity to which
idealism had begun to pin its faith.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The musicians of the seventeenth century,
instinctively aware that folk-music somehow
succeeded in voicing a wider arc of the full circle
of feeling than the conventional ecclesiastical
art, applied themselves with enthusiasm to the
endeavor to assimilate and idealize it, to turn
the current of its pulsing blood into the torpid
veins of academic music, at the same time refining
its crudities and broadening its proportions.
The result of their effort was the suite, or series
of dances and songs, the most popular and
prevalent authorized form of that century. The
suite was, indeed, in its degree a successful embodiment
of folk-types of expression in a form
broad and dignified enough to satisfy æsthetic
demands. But it was not capable of extended
growth. The shortness of its movements, their
over-obvious scheme of phrase-balance, their
uniformity of key, rendered impossible any
great increase in complexity of form. Composers
therefore found themselves in a dilemma:
they were compelled to write either in the old
polyphonic style, which labored under insurmountable
limitations of expression, or in the
new harmonic style, which was as yet capable
only of a rudimentary scheme of form, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
therefore unsatisfactory to the sense of plastic
interest and beauty.</p>

<p>It was at this auspicious moment that Haydn,
equipped, as we have seen, with an affectionate
and sympathetic heart, beating in unison with
that of common humanity, and with a lucid,
practical, pedestrian mind, well-fitted to disentangle
and arrange in order the factors of a complex
problem, appeared in the arena. The adjustment
between his nature and his circumstances
was thus peculiarly complete. He found
in the folk-music of his native place, to begin
with, a type of emotional expression with which
he was, both as regards qualities and limitations,
in complete sympathy. &#8220;The Croatian melodies,&#8221;
says Mr. W. H. Hadow, &#8220;are bright,
sensitive, piquant, but they seldom rise to any
high level of dignity or earnestness. They belong
to a temper which is marked rather by
feeling and imagination than by any sustained
breadth of thought, and hence, while they enrich
their own field of art with great beauty, there
are certain frontiers which they rarely cross, and
from which, if crossed, they soon return.&#8221;
Could any better short description be devised
of Haydn&#8217;s own characteristic vein of sentiment&mdash;&#8220;bright,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
sensitive, piquant, but seldom rising
to any high level of dignity or earnestness&#8221;?
His music is, in fact, from the point of view of
expression, essentially an expansion, development,
and idealization of the characteristic utterance
of his race.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he had the mental grasp
necessary to organize all this crude, inchoate,
fragmentary material into the finished and coherent
forms of art. It is a long step from even
the most eloquent expressions of single aspects
of feeling, in short songs and dances, to an extended
composition in which moods are coordinated
and contrasted, proportions fitly ordered,
and unity combined with broad scope&mdash;a
step which only intelligence can make. The
technical task which faced the musicians of the
day was to find a scheme of musical form that
should knit the accents of the popular speech,
in themselves poignant and thrilling but disjointed,
fragmentary, halting, into a fluent and
rational utterance. Sir Hubert Parry explains
the situation as follows: &#8220;What Haydn had
to build upon, and what was most congenial to
him through his origin and circumstances, was
the native people&#8217;s songs and dances, which belong
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
to the same order of art in point of structure
as symphonies and sonatas; and what he
wanted, and what all men who aimed in the
same direction wanted, was to know how to
make this kind of music on a grander scale.
The older music of Handel and Bach leaned
too much towards the style of the choral music
and organ music of the church to serve him as
a model. For the principle upon which their art
was mainly built was the treatment of the separate
parts. In the modern style the artistic principle
upon which music is mainly based is the
treatment of harmonies and keys, and the way in
which those harmonies and keys are arranged.
In national dances few harmonies are used, but
they are arranged on the same principles as the
harmonies of a sonata or a symphony; and
what had to be found out in order to make
grand instrumental works was how to arrange
many more harmonies with the same effect of
unity as is obtained on a small scale in dances
and national songs.&#8221; Here again, happily, the
historic moment was favorable to Haydn.
Many tentative efforts toward a new method
of musical structure, based on an organized
contrast of themes and keys, had been made;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
and all that was needed to weld them into a
style as firm and clear as it was novel and interesting
was systematization by an orderly,
responsible, and efficient mind. Haydn had
such a mind; and he established sonata-form
on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>In this great task he was helped by study of
the experiments in the new or secular music
already made by such men as Carl Philip
Emanuel Bach,<a name='FNanchor_31_31' id='FNanchor_31_31'></a><a href='#Footnote_31_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> a son of the great Sebastian,
who struck into paths very different from the
contrapuntal ones of his father; he was helped
by the intrinsic principles of structure of the
songs and dances themselves, which made up
his musical material; but above all he was
helped by the bias of his own mind, practical
and business-like. It hardly needs demonstration
that in the initiatory period of an art-form
the chief desideratum is clearness, simplicity, a
clean, concise treatment which subordinates all
details to the salient features of the construction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
and foregoes variety rather than endanger
unity. Haydn&#8217;s temperamental make-up, the
almost childlike directness of his intellect, ensured
his fitting treatment of an art itself just
emerging from infancy.</p>

<p>The procedure of Haydn, then, in his treatment
of the problems of form, or the shaping of
his material, was chiefly notable for simplicity,
directness, shrewd adaptation of means to ends.
He was not a lover of the subtle, the recondite;
he went straight to his mark, economized his
resources, prized ready intelligibility beyond all
other qualities. This appears, first, in his initial
motifs or melodic germs; and second in his
methods of building them up into larger artistic
organisms. Look at the motifs of his &#8220;Surprise
Symphony,&#8221; for example, noting their metrical
vigor and their harmonic simplicity, particularly
in the two middle movements. The meter of
the Andante is the baldest combination of
eighth-notes and quarter-notes, like that of the
tunes children pick out on the piano; its harmony
is tonic, sub-dominant, dominant, tonic
again, and the inevitable modulation to the dominant,
and so on. The Minuet is a rollicking,
waltz-like tune, seesawing happily about from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
tonic to dominant, with some simple modulations
for variety&#8217;s sake. Haydn wrote thousands
of such motifs, all vigorous, incisive, and utterly
simple.</p>

<p>When we pass from considering the texture
or molecular tissue of the music to an examination
of its structure, or composition, the same
qualities continue to impress us. There is a constant
dearth of contrast, a constant simplicity that
to modern ears, it may be, seems like over-simplicity.
The motifs, for example, are generally
expanded into complete phrases by the addition
of more or less homogeneous or amorphous matter,
rather than by the entrance of new motifs or
figures, such as Mozart often, and Beethoven generally,
uses. The schemes of balance between
the phrases are generally obvious and mathematically
exact, four measures answering four, or
eight, eight; whereas in Beethoven, and even in
Mozart, the phrase-balance is much more subtle
and various. The transitional passages leading
from one theme to another are so perfunctory,
so conventional, that Wagner felicitously
compared them to &#8220;the clattering of dishes at
a royal feast.&#8221; The themes themselves, too, are
often but slightly contrasted in character and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
style; instead of setting a dreamy or emotional
second theme over against a sprightly or dashing
first theme, Haydn is apt to make the second
hardly more than a variation of the first.
In the development portions of his first movements,
again, where the logical power and ingenuity
of the composer is of course most sorely
taxed, Haydn is apt to resort to only the more
obvious means of exploiting his subjects, to represent
them literally, with merely a new figure
of accompaniment, or to change a major theme
to minor, or vice versa, instead of drawing forth
their latent but at first sight hidden possibilities.
He avoids radical transformations, either of harmony
or rhythm. To put the matter in the most
general terms, he is more spontaneous than
thoughtful, more vivacious than logical, more
bent on securing perfect transparency for his tonal
web than on filling it with iridescent colors,
tempting opacities, charming labyrinths of light
and shade. We must remember, however, that
Haydn was writing for people to whom the whole
scheme of thematic form was unfamiliar. His ingenuity
was taxed to be as regular as possible,
rather than to introduce attractive irregularities.
He was, in fact, laying down the first principles
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
of a novel type of art; and it is the supreme virtue
of first principles to be simple, fundamental,
unmistakable.</p>

<p>Our interest in defining Haydn&#8217;s general artistic
function as that of a pioneer, a systematizer
and law-giver, must not blind our eyes, however,
to his strokes of originality. In an occasional
daring modulation, happy irregularity, or
nicely-calculated blurring of outline, Haydn anticipates
some of Beethoven&#8217;s most characteristic
effects. In the Minuet of his Ninth Symphony,<a name='FNanchor_32_32' id='FNanchor_32_32'></a><a href='#Footnote_32_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>
for example, there are some charming
instances of &#8220;shifted rhythm&#8221;; and in that of
the Eighth he revels in odd rhythmical surprises
with a truly Beethoven-like elfishness. As for
the matter of harmonic ingenuity, the instances
are bewilderingly numerous. Two or three of
the most striking may, however, be mentioned,
and the rest left to the reader&#8217;s own research.
In the introduction of the Third Symphony, in
E-flat, Haydn makes a most interesting enharmonic
change from C-flat to B-natural, quite in
the Beethoven manner, plunging the hearer into
a mystification that clears up only with the return,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
after a few measures, to the key of C-minor,
the relative of the original key. The Introduction
of the Fifth Symphony contains similar ingenious
modulations. But the most Beethovenish
trick of all is perhaps the modulation back
to the last entrance of the main theme of the
Finale of this same symphony. The key of the
movement is D-major; Haydn, however, getting
himself well established in F-sharp minor,
harps on C-sharp as the dominant of this distant
key; many C-sharps are heard, in a persistent
rhythm of two shorts and a long, until
one has forgotten all about the original key of
the piece; the C-sharps fade away to piano, then
to pianissimo, then to silence; when suddenly,
in the same rhythm, three loud D&#8217;s bring the
piece emphatically back to the home key, and
forthwith it proceeds merrily upon its way. This
device is surprisingly unlike Haydn in his usual
jog-trot mood; it is amazingly like the daring
strokes of his great successor. The C-sharp is
drummed into us until we take it for granted,
and conceive it wholly as the dominant of
F-sharp-minor; and then by his sudden
blast of D&#8217;s the composer shows us that he
had after all decided to consider it the leading-note
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
of the home key&mdash;and therewith, home we are!</p>

<p>But in spite of some striking anticipations of
later effects, Haydn is for the most part, and in
the long run, a true child of his own epoch, writing
with its concern for clearness of form, its somewhat
gingerly treatment of contrast, its quaint,
old-fashioned, and yet awakened spirit. He assimilated
the best capacities of music as he found
them, and by dint of his skill and perseverance,
moulded them until they issued forth in what
was to all intents and purposes a new art. But
the novelty in this art was not the novelty of a
new vision, a new character, a new personal ideal;
it was the novelty of a more perfect adjustment
than had yet been achieved of expressive impulses
and formal principles already widely disseminated.
Haydn&#8217;s great achievement was the
development of popular types of expression into
a true art by the application to them of schemes
of design, or form, which in his day had just
become possible for the first time as a result of
the pioneer work in harmonic and rhythmic organization
done by his immediate predecessors.
Lacking either of these two constituents, Haydn&#8217;s
art could not have existed; and coming into being
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
as a resultant of both, it had qualities of its
own, different from those of either one of its
factors alone. It marked, indeed, the beginning
of secular music as a mature art.</p>

<p>The final emphasis in any definition of Haydn&#8217;s
qualities, whether of expression or of form, depends
on the point of view from which it is made,
on whether he is considered as a follower of Palestrina
or as a forerunner of Beethoven. In comparison
with Palestrina he is a modern. In common
with his immediate predecessors, but more
fully and definitely than any of them, he turns
away from the ecclesiastical inspiration and the
contrapuntal forms of the sixteenth century, to
establish himself solidly on the untrammeled expression
of universal human feeling, through
forms based on harmonic and rhythmic principles.
He sacrifices the dignity, the peace, the
detachment, of Palestrina, in order to voice the
self-consciousness, the mobile vitality, the turbulence
and struggle and ebullient life of the modern
man. For this reason, as well as because of
the forms he uses, he is &#8220;the first of secular
composers,&#8221; &#8220;the father of instrumental music.&#8221;
Yet he is not free as Beethoven is free, nor is
his individualism the fierce nonconformity of the
great anarch of outworn conventions and restricting
formulæ. His methods, compared with Beethoven&#8217;s,
are rigid, narrow, inelastic; the music
they shaped had something of the angular outline
of all childlike art. Had it not been for their
regularity, however, Beethoven&#8217;s felicitous daring
would have miscarried; without their order as a
point of departure, his &#8220;splendid experiments&#8221;
would have led, not to freedom, but to chaos.
Mozart&#8217;s playful nickname of &#8220;Papa Haydn&#8221;
is more than a term of endearment; it is a condensed
philosophy. Haydn was indeed the
father of instrumental composers, in this sense:
that he laid the foundation for all their performance,
and that they made the advances, in the
light of which he appears old-fashioned, only by
a wise use of resources inherited from him.</p>

<p class='p4 center'>CHAPTER VI<br />
MOZART</p>


<p>Although Mozart, born
twenty-four years later than
Haydn, and therefore belonging
to another generation, was
under heavy obligations to his
forerunner for technical resources and models
of style, his disadvantage in years was so much
more than cancelled by the superior brightness
of his genius that he in his turn was able to exert
a potent influence upon the older man. The
two great predecessors of Beethoven, accordingly,
can be understood only when they are
considered as subject to mutual influences, as
supplementing each other through a delicate
play of action and reaction. Haydn led the
way into the <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>terra incognita</i>, did the rough work
of clearing the ground, but it was Mozart who
turned the wilderness into a garden. The chief
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
dates of the two careers indicate concisely their
interaction. Haydn was born in 1732, Mozart
in 1756; yet Haydn, although he began writing
symphonies as early as 1759, when Mozart
was but four years old, wrote none that can
compare with the younger man&#8217;s until 1791, or
after Mozart had written his three great symphonies
of 1788. As with the symphony, so it
was with the string quartet. Haydn opened
up the way, but Mozart, outrunning him, became
eventually the leader. It was a sort of
hare and tortoise race in which, to the confusion
of morality, the hare won.</p>

<p>Both circumstances and endowment fitted
Mozart, in this case, for the rôle of hare. The
son of a professional musician, who wisely directed
his early studies, and opened to him in
his impressionable years all the advantages of
companionship with musicians and with people
of general cultivation, he came by good fortune
into immediate possession of all the favoring
conditions that Haydn had to struggle up to
through years of poverty, neglect, and hard labor.
It would be hard to imagine more dissimilar
lots in life. The contrast between the
two men thus externally induced was accentuated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
by their opposite characters. Haydn, as
we have seen, was an intensely human person,
full of sympathy for the ordinary and yet always
appealing emotions of common humanity,
and looking at music largely as a means for
their expression. Mozart, on the contrary, was
an artist pure and simple. His genius was almost
completely independent of his character,
and it was by virtue of the former that he was
great. His sensitiveness to the minutest distinctions
and gradations in sound, his unerring
instinct for perfection in form, in the smallest
as in the largest instances, his wonderful power
to shape a multitude of details into a breathing
organism, his Greek serenity of temper and indifference
to ranges of feeling that might perturb
his art&mdash;all these things gave him an incalculable
advantage over the plodding Haydn
as a master of the purely artistic side of musical
composition. They enabled him to assimilate
instantaneously all that the older man had to
teach him of design, and to become his teacher
before he had done with learning from him.
Haydn showed Mozart how to do things; and
in return Mozart showed Haydn how to do
them better.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Both men were clearly aware of their obligations
to each other. In the midst of the petty
jealousies and the malicious efforts to stir up
ill-feeling which characterized musical Vienna
in their day, they remained warm friends and
mutual admirers. Mozart dedicated his six
finest string quartets to Haydn, with the comment: &#8220;It
was due from me, for it was from
Haydn that I learned how quartets should be
written.&#8221; &#8220;It was affecting,&#8221; says a contemporary
observer, &#8220;to hear him speak of the two
Haydns or any other of the great masters; one
would have imagined him to be one of their enthusiastic
pupils rather than the all-powerful
Mozart.&#8221; Haydn&#8217;s respect for Mozart was
equally profound, and even more creditable, in
that he was older and less appreciated by the
Viennese public than the man he lost no opportunity
to praise. He often asserted that he
never heard one of Mozart&#8217;s compositions without
learning something from it; and once when
&#8220;Don Giovanni&#8221; was being discussed he made
a period to the argument by saying: &#8220;I cannot
decide the questions in dispute, but this I
know, that Mozart is the greatest composer in
the world.&#8221; Mozart was thus much more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
a mere successor of Haydn in the usual course
of musical evolution; he gave fully as much as
he received. His short though full life, moreover,
came to an end eighteen years before
Haydn&#8217;s more leisurely one; so that in a purely
human as well as an artistic sense, we can look
upon him, in relation to Haydn, as a sort of brilliant
younger brother.</p>

<p>Johann Chrysostum Wolfgang Theophilus
Mozart, generally known to the world as Wolfgang
Amadeus<a name='FNanchor_33_33' id='FNanchor_33_33'></a><a href='#Footnote_33_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a> Mozart, was born at Salzburg,
a small town southwest of Vienna, in Austria-Hungary,
on January 27, 1756. His father
was Leopold Mozart, a professional musician
of excellent abilities, court-composer to the
Archbishop of Salzburg, and author of a School
for the Violin which in its day was known
throughout Europe. He was a devoted father,
and although there has been some difference of
opinion as to his character, it is certain that he
spared no pains in the education of his son,
which he considered the chief business of his
life. He has been charged with penuriousness,
with narrowness and bigotry, and with having
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
forced his son to be a prodigy for the sake of
gain; but there is no evidence that he ever acted
unconscientiously, and the very thoroughness
and almost mechanical regularity of the training
he gave Wolfgang were invaluable in laying
the foundations of his remarkable technique.</p>

<p>Under his father&#8217;s careful tutelage the young
Wolfgang, together with his sister Maria Anna,
who was almost equally precocious, advanced
rapidly in music. When he was but three he
picked out simple chords at the piano; at four
he played minuets and other short pieces; and
at five he composed them. His early compositions
were carefully copied out in a sketch-book,
at first by his father and later by himself,
and dated; so that we have documentary evidence
that they were actually written by him
at an almost incredibly early age. The first,
dictated when he was five years old, is a Minuet
and Trio.</p>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE XIV. MOZART&#8217;S FIRST COMPOSITION. MINUET, WITH TRIO.</div>
</div>


<p>In this childlike but well-organized piece is
shown already a perfect mastery of the simple
three-part song-form which is, as we have seen,
the structural embryo of the sonata. Both minuet
and trio consist of (a) an eight-measure sentence,
cadencing in the dominant, or contrasted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
tonal centre, (b) a four-measure clause of contrast,
and (c) a four-measure clause echoing the
last half of the first sentence, and closing in the
home-key. Thus both halves of the piece, and
the entire piece, as a whole, illustrate the fundamental
principles of musical design in a very
consummate way. All this, however, Mozart
might have done simply by careful observation
and imitation of methods familiar to all contemporary
composers. What is therefore even more
remarkable in such early work is the variety of
detail that he manages to introduce. In view
of the fact, which we shall later find very significant,
that his skill as an artist lay largely in his
command over <em>variety</em> of effect (while Haydn&#8217;s
consisted more in the salient unity of his composition),
it is exceedingly interesting to note
that, at five years old, Mozart uses so complex
a device as shifted rhythm<a name='FNanchor_34_34' id='FNanchor_34_34'></a><a href='#Footnote_34_34' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a> in the manipulation
of his motif. In the fifth measure of the minuet,
namely, he writes his motif on the second
and third beats, thus producing a very charming
effect of cross-accentuation. It is also noticeable
that in so short a piece as this we find
triplets (measures 7 and 15) and groups of sixteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
notes (in the trio), obviously introduced
for the sake of rhythmic diversity.</p>

<p>Even greater ingenuity, of a similar sort, is
shown in a piece which he composed in March,
1762. The theme runs like this:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag222.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>
<img src='images/score_pag222.jpg' width='520' height='554' alt='' />
<div class='caption'>FIGURE XV.</div>
</div>

<p>How many composers, whether aged six or
sixty, would have spontaneously thought of so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
charming an arrangement of the phrases, which
we may symbolize with the letters A B B A C C?
Most minds would have traveled the old time-honored
rut, writing A B A B in something
like this fashion:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score1_pag223.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE XVI.</div>
</div>

<p>But Mozart knew how to compose. Nor does
his ingenuity fail him when in the last section
of the piece he wishes, while repeating the essence
of his idea, to reach the tonic instead of
the dominant key. Simply dropping out the
second A-phrase, he writes:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score2_pag223.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE XVII.</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>[224]</a></span></p>
<p>and the trick is done. It was by a steadily
broader application of principles such as are here
illustrated that he gradually became so marvelously
skilful in composition.</p>

<p>Concerning the extraordinary physical delicacy
of the young Mozart&#8217;s ear there are many
stories, some of which are probably true. He
is said to have fainted on hearing a trumpet.
According to Schachtner, an intimate friend of
the Mozarts, he was able to perceive an interval
of pitch so small as the eighth of a tone. The
story is that Wolfgang was allowed to play one
day on Schachtner&#8217;s violin, which he called, on
account of its full, rich tone, &#8220;Butter-fiddle.&#8221;
&#8220;Herr Schachtner,&#8221; he announced a few days
later, &#8220;your violin is half a quarter of a tone
lower than mine; that is, if it is tuned as it was
when I played it last.&#8221; The violin was brought
out, and proved, Schachtner says, to be pitched
as the boy had stated. As Schachtner, trained in
literature by Jesuits, had the literary man&#8217;s instinct
for effective statement, it is necessary to
discount such tales a little; but the extraordinary
delicacy of Mozart&#8217;s ear is sufficiently proved.
For that matter, it needs no proof; so keen a
sense of design would have been impossible to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
him had he lacked the requisite physical basis
of accurate perception and discrimination of
tones.</p>

<p>The first twenty-five years of Mozart&#8217;s life
were spent largely in professional tours, as
a piano virtuoso, with intermittent periods at
home in Salzburg devoted to study and composition.
Appearing as a boy-prodigy when he was
only six years old, before he was twenty-five he
had made five extended and uniformly successful
tours. He appeared in most of the larger
German and Italian cities, as well as in Brussels,
Amsterdam, Paris, and London, everywhere giving
new proofs of the quickness, elasticity, and
certainty of his musical powers. In Paris, when
eight years old, he &#8220;accompanied a lady in an
Italian air without seeing the music, supplying
the harmony for the passage which was to follow
from that which he had just heard. This
could not be done without some mistakes, but
when the song was ended he begged the lady
to sing it again, played the accompaniment and
the melody itself with perfect correctness, and
repeated it ten times, altering the character of
the accompaniment for each.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_35_35' id='FNanchor_35_35'></a><a href='#Footnote_35_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a> &#8220;On a melody
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
being dictated to him, he supplied the bass and
the parts without using the clavier at all.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_36_36' id='FNanchor_36_36'></a><a href='#Footnote_36_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> In
Rome, when fourteen years old, after hearing
Allegri&#8217;s Miserere sung in the Papal chapel by
a nine-part chorus, he went home and copied
out from memory the entire work. A few mistakes
were corrected after a second hearing. Such
feats as this bespeak a mastery of the technique
of pure music even more remarkable, and far
more important, than his so much talked of skill
as a performer on the piano, organ, and violin.
Had music not become to him in early youth
a natural language, a second mother-tongue, he
could never have learned, in his manhood, to
manipulate it with such extraordinary freedom,
ingenuity, and power.</p>

<p>In the intervals of his travels, Mozart had to
spend his time in Salzburg, a town almost intolerably
uncongenial. It was a dull, provincial
place, the butt of innumerable sarcasms. There
was a saying: &#8220;He who comes to Salzburg becomes
in the first year stupid, in the second idiotic,
and in the third a true Salzburger;&#8221; and
Mozart, in whom taste and experience wrought
together to make provincialism odious, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
never tired of telling of a Salzburgian who complained
that he could not judge Paris satisfactorily,
&#8220;as the houses were too high and shut off
the horizon.&#8221; &#8220;I detest Salzburg and everything
that is born in it,&#8221; he wrote; &#8220;the tone
and the manners of the people are utterly insupportable.&#8221;
Such a place would have been
distasteful enough to the gay and highly social
temperament of Mozart even had he had no responsibilities
there; but it was his position of
music-director to the Archbishop of Salzburg,
with the dependence it involved, that finally exhausted
his patience. Hieronymus, who became
Archbishop in 1772, was a man famed for his
churlishness and arrogant, bullying ways. He
made his poor music-director&#8217;s life a burden;
he treated him as a hireling, made him eat with the
servants, and called him contemptuous names,
such as &#8220;Fex,&#8221; &#8220;Lump,&#8221; &#8220;Lausbube.&#8221; Mozart,
driven to desperation, finally applied for
his discharge. Receiving no attention, he went
in person to press the matter, and was then actually
thrown from the Archbishop&#8217;s ante-room
by a petty official. This insult marked the end
of his galling relation with his patron. From
1781 until his death he lived in Vienna, picking
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
up a scanty livelihood by teaching and giving
concerts.</p>

<p>His situation, after this open rupture with
the system of patronage which was the only
solid dependence of the eighteenth-century
composer, was most precarious. The Viennese
public was notoriously fickle towards even the
most popular pianists and teachers, while the
number of educated people who could be depended
upon to buy serious compositions was
small, and publishers were consequently unable
to pay composers so well as they could in
Beethoven&#8217;s day. To make matters worse,
Mozart was careless in money affairs, luxurious
in his tastes, and so weakly amiable that he
would at any time give a friend his last kreutzer.
We cannot, then, be surprised that when
Leopold Mozart, who was naturally cautious,
conservative, and worldly, heard that his son
had taken lodgings with a certain Madame
Weber, in Vienna, and fallen in love with her
daughter Constanze, he summarily commanded
him to break off the affair. Mozart respectfully
but firmly refused to deprive Constanze,
whose position in the house of her shiftless and
half-drunken mother had aroused his pity, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
the benefit of his friendship; and as his father
had foreseen, this friendship rapidly deepened
into love.</p>

<p>Leopold Mozart for a long time stubbornly
withheld his consent to the marriage; but at
last, overborne by his son&#8217;s persistence and by
the intercession of friends, he gave the pair a
reluctant blessing. They were married August
4, 1782. The sequel proved that both father
and son were justified in their opinions. The
Mozart ménage was truly most erratic. Husband
and wife were equally improvident and
unmethodical. They were always poor, frequently
in actual want. On the other hand, as
Wolfgang had hoped, Constanze&#8217;s virtues as a
comrade compensated for her deficiencies as a
housekeeper, and their congeniality of temperament
made them contented in the midst of
disorder, poverty, and care. There is a story
that a friend, calling on them one cold winter
morning, found them waltzing together, and
was told that, as they had no fuel, they were
keeping warm in that way. The incident is typical
of their existence&mdash;irresponsible, haphazard,
and yet on the whole happy.</p>

<p>The remaining events of Mozart&#8217;s short life,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
from his marriage in 1782 to his death in 1791,
were all artistic events&mdash;works composed&mdash;standing
out luminous against a dark background
of poverty, struggle, and pain. His
three great operas were written during this time.
&#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; was first produced
at Vienna in 1786; &#8220;Don Giovanni&#8221; at Prague,
in 1787; and &#8220;The Magic Flute&#8221; at Vienna,
in the year of Mozart&#8217;s death. In the realm
of absolute music Mozart was equally productive
all through this period. The six great
string quartets dedicated to Haydn date from
1782, 1783, and 1784. The three quartets
written for Frederick William II of Prussia
were composed in the spring of 1790. The four
greatest string quintets were written in 1787,
1790, and 1791. Finally, the three finest and
maturest symphonies, works which will endure
as long as music does, were all written within
two months in the summer of 1788. His last
work was the famous Requiem, begun in July,
1791. His strong constitution was now beginning
to give way under the long strain of poverty
and unceasing mental labor, and he gradually
became haunted by the idea that he was
writing this Requiem for himself. He grew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
morbid and gloomy, but continued to work with
feverish energy. The last evening of his life
he looked at his unfinished score with tears in
his eyes, saying, &#8220;Did I not say I was writing
the Requiem for myself?&#8221; And later, when
he became delirious, he was still busy with the
Requiem, imagining it played, and blowing out
his cheeks to imitate the trumpets. He died
quietly on the evening of December 5, 1791,
having accomplished an enduring work in
thirty-five laborious, brilliant, and painful
years.</p>

<p>This story of Mozart&#8217;s last ten years is undoubtedly
one of the strangest pages of musical
biography. The contrast between his external
and his internal life is so violent, so startling,
that we rub our eyes involuntarily, wondering
if the facts as we know them can be true. And
indeed we can believe in them only when we
assume that his mind was independent of its
environment to a degree uncommon even with
genius. Mozart seems to have been a dual
person, to have lived two lives at once; outwardly
hounded by creditors, worn with the
most prostrating and debasing anxiety, forgetting
his cares only in a dissipation that was as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
squalid as they, he was all the time pursuing
his artistic ideals with the highest success, and
with the serenity of complete mastership. In
his nature it was not even a step from the ridiculous
to the sublime&mdash;the two extremes coexisted
and interlaced.</p>

<p>The case of Mozart is in fact an eloquent
human proof of the truth of Schopenhauer&#8217;s
theory that pure music is a world by itself, parallel
with the actual world of ordinary experience
but independent of it. The plastic artist
works in materials familiar to his ordinary experience;
he puts in his pictures or statues the
men, women, animals, trees, and other physical
objects that he sees about him daily. Not so
the musician. He deals with ideas that have
no existence outside of his art; and he therefore
constantly keeps up in his mind two independent
trains of thought, coexistent but unrelated.
That Mozart, whose purely musical
genius was perhaps the brightest and most complete
that ever existed, habitually lived this
double mental life, there are many evidences.
His sister-in-law described him as follows:
&#8220;He was always good-humored, but thoughtful
even in his best moods, looking one straight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
in the face, and always speaking with reflection,
whether the talk was grave or gay; and yet he
seemed always to be carrying on a deeper train
of thought. Even when he was washing his
hands in the morning, he never stood still, but
walked up and down the room humming, and
buried in thought. At table he would often
twist up a corner of the table-cloth, and rub his
upper lip with it, without appearing in the least
to know what he was doing, and he sometimes
made extraordinary grimaces with his mouth.
His hands and feet were in continual motion,
and he was always strumming on something&mdash;his
hat, his watch-fob, the table, the chairs, as
if they were the clavier.&#8221; Other contemporaries
have recorded that he carried on this musical
thought while having his hair dressed, while
bowling or playing billiards, while talking or
joking, and even, wonderful to say, while listening
to other music that did not especially
interest him. &#8220;The greater industry of his
later years,&#8221; said his wife, &#8220;was merely apparent,
because he wrote down more. He was
always working in his head, his mind was in
constant motion, and one may say that he never
ceased composing.&#8221; Lange, his brother-in-law,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
observed that &#8220;when he was engaged on his
most important works he took more than his
usual share in any light or jesting talk that was
going on.&#8221; When his wife was confined of her
first child he was working on the second of the
quartets dedicated to Haydn; he brought his
table to her room, and frequently rose to cheer
or comfort her in her pain, without apparently
interrupting his train of thought. On the evening
before the day set for the first performance
of &#8220;Don Giovanni,&#8221; the overture was still unwritten,
though Mozart doubtless had it perfectly
clear in his mind. He sat up most of the
night copying it out, his wife meantime plying
him with punch and with stories to keep him
awake; and by seven in the morning it was
complete. When he sends his sister a prelude
and fugue he apologizes for the prelude being
copied after the fugue instead of before it.
&#8220;The reason was,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;that I had already
composed the fugue, and wrote it down
while I was thinking out the prelude.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is necessary to bear constantly in mind this
independence, activity, and self-sufficiency of
Mozart&#8217;s musical thought-processes, if we would
at all understand the paradox of his personality.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
Mozart the man, and Mozart the musician,
were two beings. The man, when all is
said, and in spite of many endearing traits, was
disappointingly commonplace. Although he
was a good linguist, and fond, as a boy, of
mathematics, he was intellectually undistinguished.
His letters are rather conventional,
he kept no journal, he read little, and though
he said a sharp or clever thing now and then
his conversation was not remarkable. Emotionally
he was also not unusual. Amiable,
generous, and honorable, he was rather lacking
in will-power, rather immature and unformed.</p>

<p>His mental attitude and his conduct in the
world were curiously childlike. He was even
unable to care for his own person; his wife attended
to his clothes and cut up his meat at
table. In money matters he was not a child, but
a baby. Only six months after his marriage he
began a long course of borrowing, in small sums,
from friends and relatives, and he became later
a familiar figure to the Viennese pawnbrokers
and usurers. To make matters worse, he was
so kind-hearted that he could not endure the
sight of suffering when he had money to relieve
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
it. The result was that he gave away freely
what he had borrowed with difficulty, and sunk
daily deeper in the morass of hopeless debt. His
dealings with Albert Stadler, an excellent clarinetist
and a wholly unreliable man, will serve as
a specimen of his guilelessness. Being asked by
Stadler for a loan of fifty ducats, he gave him instead
two valuable watches to place in pawn, on
the understanding that he should redeem them
in due time. Of course Stadler did nothing
about it; whereupon Mozart gave him the fifty
ducats, together with interest, so that he might
redeem the watches. Stadler kept the money.
And what is more remarkable, Mozart seems
to have cordially forgiven him, and later to have
made him further loans.</p>

<p>Mozart&#8217;s high spirits were unquenchable. A
tireless jester, a graceful dancer, a good hand at
billiards, clever as an impromptu poet of doggerel
verses and as a deviser of practical jokes,
he found in society the relaxation he needed from
the severe mental concentration of composing;
and there is no doubt that he gave himself up
to conviviality and to frivolous amours more
than would to-day be considered becoming. His
fondness for wine and punch were generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
known, and he himself confessed to his wife that
he was not always faithful to her. But it must
be remembered that in pleasure-loving Vienna,
in the eighteenth century, manners were lax, and
that Mozart, although by his very sensitiveness
peculiarly subject to temptation, was never
grossly or habitually vicious. His failings were
those of a high-spirited, vivacious, ardent temperament,
combined with an amiable, but not a
profound character. There was no depravity in
him, but there was at the same time little moral
or mental elevation. His humor, which bubbled
forth unceasingly, was of the flavor of the comic
papers and of tavern horse-play. He used to
make his friend Leutgeb, a horn-player, submit
to mock penances as the price of concertos for
his instrument. Once the penalty was to collect
all the orchestral parts from the floor, where
Mozart threw them as they were copied; another
time it was to sit behind the stove until
the piece was written. The score of one of these
concertos bears the inscription: &#8220;Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart takes pity on Leutgeb, ass,
ox, and simpleton, at Vienna, March 27, 1783.&#8221;
Another is written in black, red, blue, and green
ink. Mozart was fond of writing, to original
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
doggerel words, for performance by gatherings
of his friends, comic canons, in which the curious
duality of his nature is strikingly illustrated.
The words were colloquial, full of slang, and
often coarse; the music, written in one of the
most severe of contrapuntal forms, was always
gracious and consummately wrought as only
Mozart knew how to make it. His musical humor
reaches its acme in the &#8220;Musikalische
Spass,&#8221; or, as he himself called it, the &#8220;Peasants&#8217;
Symphony,&#8221; for string quartet and two
horns. This is nothing less than a parody of
the kind of work that Mozart was constantly
producing in all seriousness&mdash;a Divertimento in
regular form, but supposed to be written by a
tyro and played by amateurs. The horns come
in pompously with wrong notes; the first violin,
ascending a long scale, goes half a tone too high;
at the end, in the midst of a fanfare in F-major
by the horns, the string instruments strike in
each in a different key. &#8220;The attempt after
thematic elaboration,&#8221; says Jahn, &#8220;is very ludicrous;
it is as though the composer had heard
of such a thing, and strove to imitate it in a few
phrases, greatly to his own satisfaction. The
art is most remarkable whereby the pretended
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
ignorance never becomes wearisome, and the audience
is kept in suspense throughout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus at every turn are we impressed with that
wondrous inspiration and skill as an artist which
were so curiously combined in Mozart with lack
of distinction as a man. Even Haydn, for all
his normality and usualness of emotion, had a certain
human quaintness and sweetness for which
we miss any analogue in Mozart. Yet when we
shift the point of view, and study the artists rather
than the men, it is Mozart who stands out as the
more interesting figure. As we saw in the last
chapter, Haydn&#8217;s power as an artist depended
chiefly on the trenchancy and practical grasp of
his mind, by which he was enabled to crystallize
into forms of salient unity the motifs, phrases,
and sections of his music. System is the key-note
of his work; he was an organizer, both by
natural faculty, and in obedience to the needs
of his time. And he had the defects of his merits,
in a certain monotony, angularity, and cut-and-dried
precision. Mozart, on the contrary,
even in his earliest pieces, already cited, showed
a more flexible artistic technique; and beginning
where Haydn left off, he was able to carry the
same sort of organization into a higher stage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
combining with the unity of the whole a much
greater diversity in the parts. Variety is as notable
in Mozart&#8217;s work as unity in Haydn&#8217;s. His
art is more subtle, and not a whit less solid.</p>

<p>In the first place as regards the themes themselves,
Mozart&#8217;s are longer and more complex
than Haydn&#8217;s. It is hard to imagine Haydn
disposing his phrases with the ingenuity and mental
grasp shown by the melody in Figure XV.,
written when Mozart was only six years old.
The characteristic of this melody is that the
phrases are not immediately repeated, thereby
balancing in the most obvious way, but alternated
with apparent whimsicality, which, however,
eventually issues in order. This is even
more conspicuously shown by the following
theme from Mozart&#8217;s great G-minor Quintet:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag240.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>
<img src='images/score_pag240.jpg' width='520' height='262' alt='score_pag240' />
<div class='caption'>FIGURE XVIII.</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Here a broad and perfectly poised melody is
evolved from two simple motifs by a deftly managed
accretion. The effect reminds one of Beethoven;
Haydn could scarcely have conceived it.</p>

<p>In harmony Mozart is more venturesome than
his predecessor. His harmonic structure, while
no less clear than Haydn&#8217;s, is less bald, less
obvious. In the fifth of the quartets dedicated
to Haydn, for example, in A-major, there is an
early and pronounced modulation to C-major;
after which the second theme comes in regularly
in the dominant key. The effect of this insistence
on a comparatively distant key is to blur
slightly the contour of the form, and to prevent
any possible sense of triteness. In the Finale
of the third quartet, Mozart, after ending his
first part strongly in C-major, jumps suddenly,
quite without warning, to an emphatic chord of
D-flat major,&mdash;a device by which we are irresistibly
reminded of the complete shifts of tonality at
the beginning of the coda of the first movement
of the &#8220;Eroica&#8221; Symphony. Perhaps the most
brilliant stroke of genius in harmonic conception
that Mozart ever made, however, is the famous
passage introducing the C-major Quartet.
It runs as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>[242]</a></span></p>
<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag242.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 465px;'>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE XIX. INTRODUCTION TO MOZART&#8217;S C-MAJOR QUARTET.</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>[243]</a></span></p>
<p>It was to passages of this kind (though even
Mozart could not write many equalling it in
supernal beauty and mystery of effect) that he
owed his reputation for heterodoxy and radicalism
among the pedants of the time. A
musical connoisseur of Vienna is said to have
torn up the instrumental parts of these quartets
in his anger at finding that &#8220;the discords
played by the musicians were really in the
parts&#8221;; the parts were also returned from Italy
as being &#8220;full of printer&#8217;s errors&#8221;; and even so
good a musician as Fétis undertook to &#8220;correct&#8221;
this very Introduction. Thus to scandalize the
conservative is ever the effect of the daring,
novel, and unprecedented conceptions of genius.</p>

<p>Mozart&#8217;s rhythms, again, are much more various
than Haydn&#8217;s. The characteristic figures
of his themes are apt to be strongly contrasted,
whereas Haydn&#8217;s generally bear a family resemblance
to one another. Take, for example,
the themes of the first movement of Mozart&#8217;s
String Quintet in G-minor. The first is a
simple series of eighth-notes:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag243.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>
<img src='images/score_pag243.jpg' width='520' height='131' alt='score_pag243' />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The second is more resilient and individual:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score1_pag244.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>
<img src='images/score1_pag244.jpg' width='520' height='83' alt='score1_pag244' />
</div>

<p>The third, or conclusion-passage, is of a most
strongly marked character:</p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score2_pag244.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>
<div class='figcenter' style='width: 520px;'>
<img src='images/score2_pag244.jpg' width='520' height='76' alt='score2_pag244' />
</div>

<p>Not only do these figures contrast well as they
appear successively, but Mozart knows how to
combine them in a very intricate web. When
the third one enters in the 'cello, the second violin
and viola toss back and forth the first, the
second viola plays a slow sustaining part in quarter
and half-notes, and the first violin has a racing
counterpoint in sixteenth-notes. All this
means life, variety, interest. And as for the question
of diversity in phrase-structure, it is only
necessary to compare the Minuet of Mozart&#8217;s
G-minor Symphony, with its odd three-measure
phrases and its wide climactic stretches of melody,
with the square-cut Minuet of Haydn&#8217;s Surprise
Symphony, to gain a vivid idea of the
younger composer&#8217;s superiority in rhythmic life.</p>

<p>In the general construction of his works,
moreover, Mozart is more skillful than Haydn.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
Haydn&#8217;s transitions from theme to theme are
frequently conventional to a degree&mdash;passages
of scales or arpeggios unrelated to the thematic
material, and therefore mechanical in effect.
Mozart, whose melodic fecundity was limitless,
is much more apt to write new, subsidiary melodies
for his transitions; and though such passages
lacked the fine economy of Beethoven&#8217;s
carefully wrought transitions, founded on the
themes themselves, yet they were far more vital
than Haydn&#8217;s empty formulas. When it came
to the working out of the themes, in the &#8220;development
section&#8221; of the sonata, Mozart
again had Haydn at a disadvantage, owing to
his greater contrapuntal technique, the result
of early study, and to the superior native logic
of his mind. Haydn&#8217;s development sections
are apt to sound perfunctory; worked out more
by rule of thumb than by spontaneous fancy,
they hold together imperfectly, and seem fragmentary
and artificial. Mozart&#8217;s are more fluent,
more sequacious, and more inevitable.
Mozart is thus in all respects a more subtle
artist than Haydn.</p>

<p>In expression, the prevailing quality of Mozart&#8217;s
work is a clear serenity, an indescribable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>[246]</a></span>
joyfulness and starry beauty, the natural result
of his artistic perfection. In spite of a deep
and mordant passion that he undoubtedly voices
at times, as in the G-minor Quintet and in portions
of the quartets and the G-minor Symphony,
in spite of the breadth and heroism of
such movements as the Andante of the E-flat
Quartet and the Finale of the Jupiter Symphony,
and in spite of the mystic vagueness and
aspiration of that marvellous Introduction to
the C-major Quartet, which stamps him as an
idealist, at least <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>in posse</i>, his general tone is pagan,
unsophisticated, naïve. He not only lacks the
self-consciousness, the tragic intensity, and the
fierce, virile logic of Beethoven; he lacks the
genial, peasant humanity of Haydn. There is
an aloofness, a detachment, a rarefied purity,
about his music, that makes it difficult to describe
in terms of human feeling. It has the
irresponsible perfection, the untarnished lustre,
not to be dimmed by human tears, of the best
Greek art.</p>

<p>Every attempt that has been made to describe
in words the differences between the
music of Mozart and that of his great successor,
Beethoven, has necessarily failed. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
matter is too subtle for literary description.
Yet Henry Frédéric Amiel, with his usual marvelous
perceptiveness, wrote in his journal,
after hearing quartets by the two masters, a passage
that must be quoted here. It at least suggests
their characteristics with an unerring insight:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mozart&mdash;,&#8221; writes Amiel, &#8220;grace, liberty,
certainty, freedom, and precision of style,&mdash;an
exquisite and aristocratic beauty,&mdash;serenity of
soul,&mdash;the health and talent of the master, both
on a level with his genius; Beethoven, more
pathetic, more passionate, more torn with feeling,
more intricate, more profound, less perfect,
more the slave of his genius, more carried away
by his fancy or his passion, more moving and
more sublime than Mozart. Mozart refreshes
you, like the &#8216;Dialogues&#8217; of Plato; he respects
you, reveals to you your strength, gives you
freedom and balance. Beethoven seizes upon
you; he is more tragic and oratorical, while
Mozart is more disinterested and poetical.
Mozart is more Greek, and Beethoven more
Christian. One is serene, the other serious.
The first is stronger than destiny, because he
takes life less profoundly; the second is less
strong, because he has dared to measure himself
against deeper sorrows. His talent is not
always equal to his genius, and pathos is his
dominant feature, as perfection is that of Mozart.
In Mozart the balance of the whole is
perfect, and art triumphs. In Beethoven feeling
governs everything, and emotion troubles
his art in proportion as it deepens it.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the contrast here so well brought out
is perhaps slightly over-stated, it is certain that
between Mozart and Beethoven comes the gap
between the serene childhood and the serious and
thoroughly awakened maturity of secular music.
Even in the earliest works of Beethoven, obviously
modelled as they are in the forms and
idioms made common property by his forerunners,
there is a virility, a profundity, an intensity
of spiritual ardor, for which we look in vain in
Haydn and Mozart. In him the idealism which
with them was instinctive arrives at self-consciousness.
He is founded securely upon them,
but he carries music to higher issues than it was
in their happier and simpler natures to imagine.
In leaving Mozart, therefore, we leave the preparatory
stage of the art of pure music, to pass
into the stage in which it realized its promises
and accomplished its mission.</p>

BEETHOVEN</p>


<p>One of the most fascinating, and at
the same time, the most baffling
problem of the biographer, is
to determine just what proportion
of the characteristics of a
great man are inherited from his ancestors, and
what proportion take their origin in himself as
an individual, to what degree his personality is
merely a resultant or résumé of various qualities
converging from many points into a fresh
focus, and to what degree it is a unique creation,
without traceable precedents or ascertainable
causes. It is always possible to concoct a
given character, however striking or unusual,
by a judicious selection of ancestral traits; if we
will but search far enough back, any man&#8217;s ancestors
will make up quite an adequate representation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>[252]</a></span>
of the entire human race, so that each
of his qualities need only be observed, noted,
and traced to the particular great-grandfather
or great-great-grandmother who happened to
manifest it previously; and we can thus cleverly
explain and label the oddest individual.
The real difficulty is to explain how he happened
to inherit just these qualities and no
others, why he is, in a word, just this self instead
of some other self, equally derivable but
totally different. This difficulty has brought
the whole subject of heredity into disfavor with
some students; and it is certain that in the
present state of our knowledge the study of the
individual must precede and guide the study of
his origins. Nevertheless, there are cases in
which the essential qualities are so unmistakably
inherited that the most illuminating way to approach
an individual is through a study of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>Such a case is Beethoven&#8217;s. A French writer,
M. Teodor de Wyzewa, in a book called &#8220;Beethoven
et Wagner,&#8221; has made so masterly, so
discriminating an analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s parents
and grandparents, that no one can read it
without a strong conviction of the important
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
part played by heredity in the formation of this
extraordinarily unique, peculiar, and well-defined
character. No man ever existed who was more
intensely individual than Beethoven; yet many
of the traits which in him were so marvelously
blended, and which in the blending produced
so novel a flavor, were undoubtedly derived
from earlier, and quite undistinguished, members
of his family.</p>

<p>Beethoven&#8217;s grandfather, Ludwig van Beethoven,
born at Antwerp in 1712, was of an
old Flemish family of marked national character.
He early removed to Bonn, the seat of
the Elector of Cologne, as a court-musician,
and in 1761 became court music-director, a position
which he held with zeal and ability until
his death in 1773. &#8220;He was,&#8221; says M. de
Wyzewa, &#8220;a man of middle stature, sinewy
and thick-set, with strongly-marked features,
clear eyes, and an extreme vivacity of manner.
Great energy and a high sense of duty were
combined, in him, with a practical good sense
and a dignity of demeanor that earned for him,
in the city he had entered poor and unknown,
universal respect. His musical knowledge and
ability were considerable; and although he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
not an original composer, he had frequently
to make arrangements of music for performance
by his choir. He was a man of strong
family and patriotic sentiment, and established
in Bonn quite a colony of Flemish, his brother
and cousins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beethoven&#8217;s grandmother, on the other hand
born Maria-Josepha Poll, developed early in
her married life a passion for drink which finally
obliged her husband to send her to a convent
where she remained, without contact with the
family, until her death. It is probable that this
unfortunate tendency was but a symptom of
morbid weakness of the nervous system, beyond
the control of her will&mdash;a fact, as we
shall see, interesting in its possible bearing or
the interpretation of her grandson&#8217;s idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>In 1740 was born to this ill-assorted couple
a son, Johann van Beethoven, the father of the
composer. M. de Wyzewa treats him summarily:
&#8220;His character, like his intelligence
can be described in one word&mdash;he was a perfect
nullity&#8221;; adding, however, that he was not a
bad man, as some of the anecdotes regarding
his conduct toward his son seem to indicate:&mdash;&#8220;He
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
was merely idle, common, and foolish.&#8221;
For the rest, he was a tenor singer in the court
chapel, and he passed his leisure in taverns and
billiard-rooms.</p>

<p>Beethoven&#8217;s mother was a woman of tender
sensibilities and affections, condemned to a life
of unhappiness by the worthless character of
her husband. Her whole life was devoted to
the education of her son Ludwig, who wrote
of her: &#8220;She has been to me a good and loving
mother, and my best friend.&#8221; She was of
delicate health, and died of consumption when
Beethoven was but seventeen.</p>

<p>This was the curiously assorted set of ancestors
from which Beethoven seems to have drawn
his more prominent traits. If, to begin with,
we eliminate the father, who, as M. de Wyzewa
remarks, was an &#8220;absolute nullity,&#8221; and &#8220;merely
the intermediary between his son and his father,
the Flemish music-director,&#8221; we shall find that
from the latter, his grandfather, Beethoven derived
the foundation of his sturdy, self-respecting,
and independent moral character, that from
his mother he got the emotional sensibility that
was so oddly mingled with it, and that from his
afflicted grandmother, Maria-Josepha Poll, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>[256]</a></span>
inherited a weakness of the nervous system, an
irritability and morbid sensitiveness, that gave
to his intense individualism a tinge of the eccentric
and the pathological. Without doubt
the most important factor in this heredity was
that which came from the grandfather; and although
M. de Wyzewa is perhaps led by his
racial sympathies to assign an undue importance
to this Flemish element, yet what he has to say
of it is most suggestive. Pointing out the obvious
fact that purely German composers, as
well as poets and painters, are naturally disposed
to vagueness, sentimentality, and cloudy
symbolism, he remarks that nothing of the sort
appears in Beethoven, &#8220;whose effort was constantly
toward the most precise and positive
expression&#8221;; that he eliminated all the artifices
of mere ornament, in the interests of &#8220;a rigorous
presentation of infinitely graduated emotions&#8221;;
and that he &#8220;progressed steadily toward
simplification of means combined with
complication of effect.&#8221; He shows how Beethoven
owed to his Flemish blood, in the first
place, his remarkable accuracy and delicacy of
sensation; in the second place, his wisdom and
solid common sense, his &#8220;<i lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>esprit lucide, raisonable,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
<i lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>marchant toujours droit aux choses necessaires</i>&#8221;;
in the third place, his largeness of nature,
grandeur of imagination, robust sanity,
and heroic joy, justly likened to similar qualities
in Rubens; and finally, his moral earnestness,
that &#8220;energy of soul which in his youth sustained
him in the midst of miseries and disappointments
of all sorts, and which later enabled
him to persist in his work in spite of sickness,
neglect, and poverty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of Beethoven&#8217;s mother M. de Wyzewa says,
&#8220;Poor Marie-Madeleine, with her pale complexion
and her blonde hair, was not in vain a
woman &#8216;<i lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>souffrante et sensible</i>,&#8217; since from her
came her son&#8217;s faculty of living in the emotions,
of seeing all the world colored with sentiment
and passion.&#8221; This emotional tendency,
the writer thinks, the Flemish blood could not
have given; and &#8220;it was to the unusual union
of this profound German sensibility with the
Flemish accuracy and keenness of mind that
Beethoven owed his power to delineate with extraordinary
precision the most intimate and tender
sentiments.&#8221; With a final suggestion, tentatively
advanced, that the weaknesses of Beethoven&#8217;s
character, his changeable humor, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
sudden fits of temper, his unaccountable alternations
of gaiety and discouragement, may have
been due to a nervous malady traceable to the
grandmother, Maria-Josepha Poll, this masterly
study of Beethoven&#8217;s antecedents, from which,
whether we entirely accept its conclusions or
not, we cannot fail to gain illumination, comes
to a close.<a name='FNanchor_37_37' id='FNanchor_37_37'></a><a href='#Footnote_37_37' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a></p>

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven, the second of seven
children of Johann and Maria-Magdalena Beethoven,
was born at Bonn on the Rhine, on December
16 or 17, 1770. Inheriting the musical
talent of his father and grandfather, he early
showed so much ability that his father, stimulated
by the stories of the wondrous precocity
of Mozart, decided to make him into a boy
prodigy. Ludwig was put hard at work, at the
age of four, learning to play the piano, the violin,
and the organ, and to compose; and though
he had by no means the facility of Mozart, he
progressed so well that at thirteen he was made
&#8220;cembalist&#8221; [accompanist] in the court band
of the Elector of Cologne, whose seat was at
that time in Bonn. The first public mention
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
of Beethoven occurs in an article entitled &#8220;An
Account of the Elector of Cologne&#8217;s Chapel at
Bonn,&#8221; written in 1783, and runs as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ludwig van Beethoven is a promising boy
of eleven. [Johann van Beethoven had evidently
trimmed his son&#8217;s age to suit his own idea of
what a self-respecting prodigy&#8217;s should be.]
He plays the piano with fluency and force,
reads well at sight, and has mastered the greater
part of Sebastian Bach&#8217;s &#8216;Well-Tempered Clavichord.&#8217;
Any one acquainted with this collection
of Preludes and Fugues in every key will
understand what this means. His teacher has
given him instruction in Thorough Bass, and is
now practicing him in composition. This youthful
genius deserves assistance, that he may be
enabled to travel; if he continues as he has
begun, he will certainly become a second Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Elector of Cologne seems to have acted
upon the suggestion of the last sentence. In
1786 he sent Beethoven for a short visit to
Vienna, the Mecca of all musicians. Here he
had the privilege of playing before the great
Mozart himself, who, becoming deeply interested
in his masterly improvisation, turned to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
the company with the remark: &#8220;Look after him.
He will some day make a great name in the
world.&#8221; The visit so auspiciously begun was
unfortunately cut short by the death of Beethoven&#8217;s
mother, and he returned to Bonn
to assume the responsibilities of his inefficient
father in caring for his brothers and sisters. He
now entered on a depressing and long-continued
drudgery of teaching, which he seems to have
endured courageously. His sterling character,
as well as his genius, began to attract the attention
of many of the wealthy nobles of Bonn, patrons
of art; so that difficult as was this period
of his life, it laid a solid foundation for his subsequent
fortunes.</p>

<p>Ludwig Nohl, in his &#8220;Beethoven Depicted
by His Contemporaries,&#8221; gives an interesting
sketch of Beethoven as he appeared at about
this time to a young lady, afterwards Frau von
Barnhard, who met him at the musical soirées
of Prince Lichnowsky and Herr von Klüpfell.
&#8220;Beethoven,&#8221; says Nohl, &#8220;thought so highly
of the talents of this young girl that for several
years he sent her regularly a copy of his new
pianoforte compositions, as soon as they were
printed. Unfortunately not one of the friendly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
or joking little letters, with which he accompanied
his gifts, has been preserved: so many
handsome Russian officers frequented Herr
Klüpfell&#8217;s that the ugly Beethoven made no
impression on the young lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Klüpfell was very musical, and Beethoven
went a great deal to his house, and often
played the piano for hours, but always &#8216;without
notes.&#8217; To do this was then thought marvelous,
and delighted every one. One day a well-known
composer played one of his new compositions.
When he began, Beethoven was sitting
on the sofa; but he soon began to walk
about, turn over music at the piano, and not to
pay the least attention to the performance.
Herr Klüpfell was annoyed, and commissioned
a friend to tell him that his conduct was unbecoming,
that a young and unknown man ought
to show respect towards a senior composer of
merit. From that moment Beethoven never
set foot in Klüpfell&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frau von Barnhard has a lively recollection
of the young man&#8217;s wayward peculiarities. She
says: &#8216;When he visited us, he generally put his
head in at the door before entering, to see if
there were anyone present he did not like. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>[262]</a></span>
was short and insignificant-looking, with a red
face covered with pock marks. His hair was
quite dark. His dress was very common, quite
a contrast to the elegant attire customary in
those days, especially in our circles. I remember
quite well how Haydn and Salieri used to
sit on the sofa at one side of the little music-room,
both most carefully attired in the former
mode with wigs, shoes, and silk stockings, while
Beethoven came negligently dressed in the freer
fashion of the Upper Rhine. Haydn and Salieri
were then famous, while Beethoven excited
no interest. He spoke with a strong provincial
accent; his manner of expression was slightly
vulgar; his general bearing showed no signs of
culture, and his behaviour was very unmannerly.
He was proud, and I have known him
refuse to play, even when Countess Thun,
Prince Lichnowsky&#8217;s mother, a very eccentric
woman, had fallen on her knees before him as
he lay on the sofa, to beg him to.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>This passage gives us a glimpse of the Vienna
of the early nineteenth century, the Vienna of
Beethoven&#8217;s young manhood; and it is interesting
to note how favorable an environment,
on the whole, this capital of the musical world
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>[263]</a></span>
was for the great composer. If the middle
classes were not yet sufficiently educated in
music to support many public concerts, there
was at least among the aristocracy, who were
rich, hospitable, and music-loving, plenty of
generous patronage for rising composers. Many
of the noble families maintained private orchestras,
and paid liberally for new compositions.
Haydn, as we have seen, spent most of his life
in the service of the Esterhazys, and Mozart,
although without a regular patron after his rupture
with the Archbishop of Salzburg, wrote
many of his works for royal or noble amateurs.
Beethoven was even more generously supported.
His removal from Bonn to Vienna, in 1792, was
made at the expense of the Elector of Cologne;
and after he was once settled there he received
constant help from Rudolph, Archduke of Austria,
from Princes Lobkowitz, Lichnowsky, and
Kinsky, and from many others. Moreover,
profiting much by Haydn&#8217;s and Mozart&#8217;s pioneer
work in popularizing the higher forms of
secular music, he was able to sell all his works
to publishers at good prices, thereby supplementing
his income from patrons. By 1800
his worldly situation was secure; in that year he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>[264]</a></span>
wrote to a friend: &#8220;Lichnowsky last year settled
600 florins on me, which, together with the good
sale of my works, enables me to live free from
care as to my maintenance. All that I now
write I can dispose of five times over, and be
well paid into the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were, however, in Beethoven&#8217;s situation,
trying elements which gravely harassed
and handicapped him. In the first place, he was
as unfortunate in his family as he was fortunate
in his friends. In his case, &#8220;the closest kin
were most unkind.&#8221; Even after the death of
his shiftless and drunken father, in 1792, there
were still two brothers, Carl and Johann, who
remained throughout his life his evil geniuses.
Almost incredible is their indifference to him,
their utter failure to appreciate his noble nature.
When he was prosperous they borrowed money
from him, and even stole jewelry; when he was
poor and neglected they refused him the slightest
favors. Carl left to him the care of his worthless
son, who proved the greatest trial of his life.
Johann, by withholding his closed carriage for
a necessary winter journey, directly contributed
to the illness that ended in his death. This utter
lack of common sympathy had the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>[265]</a></span>
poisonous effect on his sensitive, affectionate nature.
It saddened, depressed, and embittered
him.</p>

<p>A second cruel disadvantage was the malady
of deafness which began to afflict Beethoven in
1798, and by the end of 1801 became serious.
At first there was merely buzzing and singing
in the ears; then came insensibility to tones of
high pitch, such as the higher register of the
flute and the overtones in human speech; and
finally such a serious deafness that he had to
give up playing in public and conducting, and
to carry on conversation by means of an ear-trumpet
or paper and pencil. Formidable to
his musical work as was such an impediment, it
was even more baneful in its effect on his relations
with men, and so upon his disposition.
As far as his work was concerned, it had its compensations,
in so far as it increased his isolation,
his concentration on the marvelously complex
and subtle involutions of his musical ideas. It
insulated him from distractions, and freed him
to explore with single mind the labyrinths of
his imagination. But on his social and emotional
life deafness wrought sad havoc&mdash;all the sadder
because the tendencies it reinforced were already
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>[266]</a></span>
too strong in Beethoven&#8217;s intense and proud
nature.</p>

<p>Beethoven had, in a peculiar degree, both the
merits and the defects of the individualist. Not
even Thoreau was more resolved to follow only
the dictates of his own genius, to find his code
of action within, in the impulses of his own
heart and mind, rather than without, in the conventions,
habits, and customs which guide the
ordinary man. Like all idealists, he believed in
the beauty and rightness of the whole world of
human feeling, revealed to him by his naïve consciousness,
not trimmed to suit prejudice or
partial views of what is proper and admissible.
Gifted with an emotional nature of rare richness
and intensity, and with an intellect capable
of dealing directly with experience on its
own account, he lived the life and thought the
thoughts that seemed good to him, quite indifferent
to accepted views which happened to run
counter. Thus his sincerity necessarily led him
into an unconventionality, an indifference to established
ways of acting, feeling, and thinking,
which, when circumstances pushed him still
further away from the common human life, easily
passed over into morbid eccentricity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>[267]</a></span></p>

<p>His unconventionality appears in all his actions
and opinions, from the most trivial to the
most momentous. Take, for instance, to begin
with, the matter of personal appearance, dress,
and demeanor. What an altogether unusual
man it was that Carl Czerny, as a boy of ten, in
1801, was taken to visit! &#8220;We mounted,&#8221; says
Czerny, &#8220;five or six stories high to Beethoven&#8217;s
apartment, and were announced by a rather dirty-looking
servant. In a very desolate room, with
papers and articles of dress strewn in all directions,
bare walls, a few chests, hardly a chair except
the ricketty one standing by the piano, there
was a party of six or eight people. Beethoven
was dressed in a jacket and trousers of long,
dark goat&#8217;s hair, which at once reminded me of
the description of Robinson Crusoe I had just
been reading. He had a shock of jet black hair,
(cut <em>à la Titus</em>), standing straight upright. A
beard of several days&#8217; growth made his naturally
dark face still blacker. I noticed also, with a
child&#8217;s quick observation, that he had cotton
wool, which seemed to have been dipped in some
yellow fluid, in both ears. His hands were covered
with hair, and the fingers very broad, especially
at the tips.&#8221; The oddity in dress observed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>[268]</a></span>
by Czerny was habitual with Beethoven.
&#8220;In the summer of 1813,&#8221; says Schindler, &#8220;he
had neither a decent coat nor a whole shirt.&#8221; His
habit of dabbling his hands in water, while following
out a musical thought, until he was thoroughly
wet, cannot have improved his clothes.
Nor did his carriage set them off: he was extremely
awkward with his body&mdash;could not dance
in time, and generally cut himself when he shaved,
which, however, he did infrequently.</p>

<p>Very marked was his unconventionality in social
relations. So profound was his sense of personal
worth and of the fatuity of arbitrary class-distinctions
that no aristocrat ever regarded his
birth and breeding, no plutocrat ever regarded
his wealth, with more intense pride than Beethoven
felt in his democratic independence and
self-sufficiency. That was a characteristic answer
he made the court, in one of his numerous
lawsuits, when asked if the &#8220;van&#8221; in his name
indicated nobility. &#8220;<em>My</em> nobility,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is
here and here&#8221;&mdash;pointing to his head and heart.
When he was offered a Prussian order, as a recognition
of his artistic achievements, he preferred
a payment of fifty ducats, and took the opportunity
to express his contempt for some people&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>[269]</a></span>
&#8220;longing and snapping after ribands.&#8221; When his
brother Johann, a stupid but prosperous worldling,
sent him a New Year&#8217;s card signed &#8220;Johann
van Beethoven, Land-owner,&#8221; he returned it with
the added inscription: &#8220;Ludwig van Beethoven,
Brain-owner.&#8221; But this wholesome self-respect,
the result of a faith in himself and a discrimination
between essences and accidents too rare
among men, sometimes became exaggerated by
passion into an impatient, egotistical pride less
pleasant to note. When the court just mentioned,
for example, refused, on the ground of
his being a commoner, to hear his case, he was
so angry that he threatened to leave the country&mdash;a
reaction as childish as it was futile. On
receiving, late in life, an honorary diploma from
the Society of Friends of Music in the Austrian
Empire, his impulse was to return it, because
he had not been earlier recognized. Nor was
he inclined to forgive readily a fancied slight to
his dignity; he was always getting embroiled
with his friends on account of some insult he
read into their conduct. He was indeed too
often the slave, instead of the master, of his own
sensitiveness, and though his point of view as an
individualist was higher than that of the herd, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>[270]</a></span>
had its own peculiar limitations. This is clearly
illustrated by the following passage in one of
his letters: &#8220;Kings and princes can indeed create
professors and privy-councillors, and confer
titles and decorations, but they cannot make great
men&mdash;spirits that soar above the base turmoil
of this world. When two persons like Goethe
and myself meet, these grandees cannot fail to
perceive what such as we consider great. Yesterday,
on our way home, we met the whole imperial
family; we saw them coming some way
off, when Goethe withdrew his arm from mine,
in order to stand aside; and say what I would,
I could not prevail on him to make another step
in advance. I pressed down my hat more firmly
on my head, buttoned up my great-coat, and,
crossing my arms behind me, I made my way
through the thickest portion of the crowd.
Princes and courtiers formed a lane for me; Archduke
Rudolph took off his hat, and the Empress
bowed to me first. These great ones of the earth
<em>know me</em>. To my infinite amusement, I saw the
procession defile past Goethe, who stood aside
with his hat off, bowing profoundly. I afterward
took him sharply to task for this.&#8221; In the
sort of pride manifested by Beethoven on this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>[271]</a></span>
occasion, there is an element of the hysterical;
had his sense of humor been applied to himself
as well as to his companion, he would have been
&#8220;infinitely amused&#8221; to behold himself, with his
hat pressed firmly on his head and his great-coat
buttoned up, demanding for the aristocracy of
genius that very servility which he despised
when it was shown to the aristocracy of rank.
It was Beethoven himself this time who, misled
by an overweening pride, was hankering after
the accident when he already possessed the essence.</p>

<p>Examined by and large, however, Beethoven
does not often disappoint us by failing to make
that distinction between the nucleus of reality
and its swathings and accompaniments, which
lay at the foundation of his greatness. Nowhere
were his instinct for the real and his contempt for
the superfluous more active than in his thoughts
on religion, the deepest and most serious topic
on which a man can think. Sturdily ignoring,
all his life, the trappings of ritual, and the narrow
preciseness, as it seemed to him, of creeds
and theologies, he as resolutely clung to the essence
of religion, the belief in a universal, inclusive
consciousness, and in the importance to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>[272]</a></span>
it of right human effort. On the practical side his
religion was eminently positive, efficient, sane;
it prompted him to full development of his genius,
without neglect of the responsibilities of ordinary
life. Of the metaphysical side it is a sufficient
description to say that there lay constantly
on his desk, copied by his own hand, these sentences:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am that which is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am all that is, that was, and that shall be.
No mortal man has lifted my veil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is alone by Himself, and to Him alone
do all things owe their being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Combined with the mental originality, the
habit of deciding all questions for himself and
as if they had never before received solutions,
which made Beethoven so pronounced a non-conformist
in all matters from his toilet to his
religion, was a physical peculiarity that underlay
much of what was grotesque about him. This
was the nervous irritability inherited from his
grandmother. His moodiness, his sudden alternations
of depressed and excited states, his
bursts of uncontrollable anger, his wild pranks
and practical jokes, were almost beyond doubt
the result of an unstable nervous system. So
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>[273]</a></span>
restless was he that he was continually changing
his lodgings; once it was because there was not
enough sun, again because he disliked the water,
another time because his landlord insisted on
making him deep obeisances; in the later part
of his life, when his habits were well known, he
had difficulty in finding rooms anywhere in Vienna.
He put little restraint upon his tongue;
Schindler says that &#8220;the propriety of repressing
offensive remarks was a thing that never entered
his thoughts.&#8221; After hearing a concerto of Ries,
he wrote a furious letter to a musical paper, enjoining
Ries no longer to call himself his pupil.
This his friends persuaded him not to send. He
was so impatient that he often took the medicines
intended for an entire day in two doses;
so absent-minded that he often forgot them altogether.
A badly cooked stew he threw at the
waiter, eggs that were not fresh at the cook. To
a lady who had asked for a lock of his hair he
sent, at the suggestion of a friend, a lock cut from
a goat&#8217;s beard; and when the joke was discovered
he apologized to the lady, but cut off
all intercourse with the friend. An English observer
wrote that &#8220;One unlucky question, one
ill-judged piece of advice, was sufficient to estrange
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>[274]</a></span>
him from you forever.&#8221; Even on his
best friends and his patrons, he wreaked his ill-humors.
When Prince Lobkowitz, to whom
he owed much, had been so unfortunate as to
offend him, he went into his court-yard, shook
his fist at the house, and cried &#8220;Lobkowitz donkey,
Lobkowitz donkey.&#8221; It is not hard to see
why casual acquaintances, who knew nothing of
the noble qualities behind his stormy and perverse
exterior, frequently thought him mad.</p>

<p>Nor will it be difficult, after this brief summary
of Beethoven&#8217;s fundamental traits, to understand
the formidable effect that deafness,
coming upon him slowly but relentlessly in early
manhood, when intellectual achievement and
social and personal happiness seemed equally
attainable, exercised upon his character. Naturally
self-dependent, deafness made him self-absorbed;
naturally proud, it made him so sensitive
to imagined slights, so suspicious of even his
best friends, that he would at times refuse all intercourse
with people; naturally taking keenest
joy in intellectual activity, this physical disability
forced him, while gradually renouncing
social pleasures, to throw himself with ever
greater concentration and completer devotion
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>[275]</a></span>
into his work. All these effects of his deafness
are clearly discernible in the letters written about
1800. &#8220;I can with truth say,&#8221; he writes in that
year, &#8220;that my life is very wretched; for nearly
two years past I have avoided all society, because
I find it impossible to say to people, <em>I am deaf</em>!&#8221;
&#8220;Plutarch,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;led me to resignation.
I shall strive if possible to set Fate at
defiance, although there must be moments in
my life when I cannot fail to be the most unhappy
of God&#8217;s creatures.... Resignation!&mdash;what
a miserable refuge! and yet it is my sole
remaining one.&#8221; And still later in the same
letter: &#8220;I live wholly in my music, and scarcely
is one work finished when another is begun; indeed,
I am now often at work on three or four
things at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many such passages occur in the letters of
this period, but in none does the pathetic mingling
of almost despairing wretchedness with a
noble courage that will not despair become so
striking as in the remarkable document known
as &#8220;Beethoven&#8217;s Will,&#8221; written to his brothers
in the fall of 1802. The summer had been a
trying one, and at the end of it Beethoven, apparently
half expecting and a little desiring death,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>[276]</a></span>
yet dreading its interruption of his beloved work,
uttered this cry of pain, which deserves to be
quoted almost entire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='rightnp'>H<small>EILIGENSTADT</small>, Oct. 6, 1802.</p>

<p class='indent1'>T<small>O</small> M<small>Y</small> B<small>ROTHERS</small> C<small>ARL AND</small> J<small>OHANN</small> B<small>EETHOVEN</small>.</p>

<p>O! you who think or declare me to be hostile, morose,
and misanthropical, how unjust you are, and how
little you know the secret cause of what appears thus
to you! My heart and mind were ever from childhood
prone to the most tender feelings of affection, and I
was always disposed to accomplish something great.
But you must remember that six years ago I was attacked
by an incurable malady, treated by unskilful
physicians, deluded from year to year by the hope of
relief, and at length forced to the conviction of a <em>lasting
affliction</em> (the cure of which may go on for years,
and perhaps after all prove impracticable).</p>

<p>Born with a passionate and excitable temperament,
keenly susceptible to the pleasures of society, I was
yet obliged early in life to isolate myself, and to pass
my existence in solitude. If I at any time resolved
to surmount all this, oh! how cruelly was I again repelled
by the experience, sadder than ever, of my defective
hearing!&mdash;and yet I found it impossible to say
to others: Speak louder; shout! for I am deaf! Alas!
how could I proclaim the deficiency of a sense which
ought to have been more perfect with me than with
other men,&mdash;a sense which I once possessed in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>[277]</a></span>
highest perfection; to an extent, indeed, that few of
my profession ever enjoyed! Alas, I cannot do this!
Forgive me therefore when you see me withdraw from
you with whom I would so gladly mingle. My misfortune
is doubly severe from causing me to be misunderstood....
Such things brought me to the verge
of desperation, and well-nigh caused me to put an end
to my life. <em>Art! art</em> alone, deterred me. Ah! how
could I possibly quit the world before bringing forth
all that I felt it was my vocation to produce? And
thus I spared this miserable life&mdash;so utterly miserable
that any sudden change may reduce me at any moment
from my best condition into the worst. It is decreed
that I must now choose <em>Patience</em> for my guide! This
I have done. I hope the resolve will not fail me steadfastly
to persevere till it may please the inexorable
Fates to cut the thread of my life.... I joyfully
hasten to meet Death. If he comes before I have had
the opportunity of developing all my artistic powers,
then, notwithstanding my cruel fate, he will come too
early for me, and I should wish for him at a more distant
period; but even then I shall be content, for his
advent will release me from a state of endless suffering.
Come when he may I shall meet him with courage.
Farewell! Do not quite forget me, even in
death; I deserve this from you, because during my life
I so often thought of you, and wished to make you
happy. Amen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>[278]</a></span></p>

<p>It is time, however, turning away from this
painful contemplation of a strong nature&#8217;s struggle
with adverse fate, to examine that artistic
work in which its strength wrought more successfully,
and to which its weaknesses were less
disastrous. Beethoven&#8217;s artistic life, as is well
known, has been divided into three periods: that
of training and assimilation, which lasted to about
1803, that of complete mastery and mature creation,
occupying about a decade, and that of exploration
of new, untravelled paths, lasting from
1813 to the end.<a name='FNanchor_38_38' id='FNanchor_38_38'></a><a href='#Footnote_38_38' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a> The division is a convenient
and natural one, as will become clear as we
go on.</p>

<p>In the technique of his art, Beethoven was
largely self-taught. It is true that he had the
privilege of some lessons with Haydn and with
the famous theoretician Albrechtsberger; but
he was too restive under strict surveillance, and
too intolerant of hard-and-fast rules, to take
kindly to their instruction, and Albrechtsberger
flatly said of him: &#8220;He will never do anything
according to rule; he has learnt nothing.&#8221; The
truth is, Beethoven was too busy with his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>[279]</a></span>
problems, the problems of structure and expression,
to pay the requisite attention to the intricacies
of counterpoint, which he never really mastered.
What he tried to do, however, he did
thoroughly. All the works of his first period,
of which the most important are the pianoforte
sonatas up to the &#8220;Waldstein,&#8221; the first three
pianoforte concertos, the String Quartets, Opus
18, and the First and Second Symphonies, show
him in the 'prentice stage, learning to treat competently
the sonata form and the secular style
inherited from Haydn and Mozart. The First
Symphony, in spite of its dignified proportions,
is essentially an exercise in acquisition. The Second,
which is the most important single work of
the entire period, is, as Grove says, an advance
rather &#8220;in dimensions and style, and in the wonderful
fire and force of the treatment, than in
any really new ideas, such as its author afterwards
introduced.&#8221; It is in the four movements prescribed
by tradition, except that a Scherzo is
substituted for the minuet. Its phraseology and
harmony recall the older manner. The themes
of the opening Allegro are built up out of short,
precise phrases, exactly balancing one another,
as will be vividly realized by anyone who will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>[280]</a></span>
compare the first theme with the corresponding
subject in the Third Symphony, so much freer
and more ingenious in contour. The transitions
are somewhat perfunctory. The second subject
appears regularly in the dominant key. The
development, in comparison with that of Beethoven&#8217;s
later work, is mechanical, obvious, trite.
In every way he is still, in the Second Symphony,
sitting at the feet of his predecessors, learning
patiently, minutely, what they have to teach him.
As Grove well says: &#8220;This symphony is the
culminating point of the old, pre-Revolution
world, the world of Haydn and Mozart; it was
the farthest point to which Beethoven could go
before he burst into that wonderful new region
into which no man before had penetrated.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_39_39' id='FNanchor_39_39'></a><a href='#Footnote_39_39' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a></p>

<p>The indebtedness of the early Beethoven to
his immediate forerunners, and the untiring
pains he took to learn his lesson thoroughly,
call for especial emphasis because so much has
been said and written of his originality, his disregard
for conventions, his non-conforming, revolutionary
tendencies. He was indeed an anarch
of outworn conventions, but he was anything but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>[281]</a></span>
an anarch of art. No man ever recognized more
cordially his inherited resources; no man was
ever less misled by a petty ideal of mere oddness,
by a confusion of idiosyncrasy with originality.
Beethoven was a great individual because he
assimilated the strength of all humanity. His
originality, like all originality that has value,
consisted in a fresh, sincere expression of universal
truths through the best technical means
which were available in his day. If any reader
has a lingering doubt of Beethoven&#8217;s faithfulness
as a student, he needs but examine the Sketchbooks
edited by Nottebohm from the original
manuscript note-books in which Beethoven laboriously
worked out his conceptions. Quite
tireless was he in the manipulation of a theme,
over and over again, until it suited his rigorous
taste; truly wonderful is the ever-sensitive discrimination
with which he excised redundancies,
softened crudities, enhanced beauties, and refined
texture, until at last the melody was as perfect,
as inevitable, as organic, as a sentence by Flaubert,
Sir Thomas Browne, or Cardinal Newman.</p>

<p>It was indeed precisely by these qualities of
the conscientious artist that Beethoven was
chiefly enabled to push his work to a higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>[282]</a></span>
stage of interest than his forerunners had attained.
He went obediently as far as they could
lead him before attempting to push further
alone. We find, even in this Second Symphony,
conceptions that Haydn and Mozart could not
have imagined; but these are worked out with
a skill and ingenuity like theirs in kind, if
greater in degree. The most striking and pervasive
difference lies in the immensely increased
closeness of texture, intensity of meaning, logic,
vigor, poignancy. All the strings are tightened,
and flabbiness, diffuseness, meaningless ornament
and filling are swept away. As Beethoven&#8217;s
self-assurance, habit of examining all conventions
for himself, and relentless discrimination
of the essence from the accident, already noted,
made him in society a brief but pregnant talker,
an eccentric but true man, so they made him a
forcible, concise, and logical musician. How
ruthlessly he discards the merely pretty, the
sensuously tickling, the amiably vapid and
pointless! He wastes no energy in preamble,
interlude, or peroration. He puts in his outline
in a few bold, right strokes, leaving much
to the intelligence of his hearers. Concentrating
his whole mind on a single thought, he follows
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>[283]</a></span>
it out relentlessly to the end, will not be distracted
or seduced into side-issues. He tolerates
no superfluous tones in his fabric, but
makes it compact, close, rigorously thematic.
The expanses of the music stretch out broad
and sequential, the climaxes unfold deliberately,
gather force and body like a rising sea. Look
through the long, complex development section
of the Allegro of the Second Symphony,
and note its fine economy of means, its surprising
grandeur of effect; see how two or three
motifs are made to flower out into the most
luxuriant forms, and how a page can be educed
from a measure. This is what is meant by thematic
development, which no man thoroughly
understood before Beethoven.</p>

<p>This insistent coherence and sequaciousness
is kept from becoming tiresome or monotonous
by the variety of the themes themselves and of
the modes adopted for developing them. Indeed,
so consummately is the fundamental progressiveness
hidden under a variegated and ever-changing
surface that the casual observer is apt
to be impressed chiefly by the sudden novelties
of effect, the unexpected alternations of loud
and soft, the collocation of contrasted rhythms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>[284]</a></span>
the prominence given to distant tonalities by
modulation, in Beethoven&#8217;s work, and to realize
its solidity and balance only after a more
careful study. Rhythmical variety alone in Beethoven
is so perpetual and so ingenious that a
large treatise would hardly suffice to describe it.
Short, nervous phrases of half-a-measure length
alternate with wide expanses where for four
or more measures there is not so much as a
comma.<a name='FNanchor_40_40' id='FNanchor_40_40'></a><a href='#Footnote_40_40' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> Motifs longer or shorter than the
measure are so adjusted as to make up considerable
passages in which the accent constantly
changes.<a name='FNanchor_41_41' id='FNanchor_41_41'></a><a href='#Footnote_41_41' class='fnanchor'>[41]</a> Diminutions and augmentations of
motifs are deftly used.<a name='FNanchor_42_42' id='FNanchor_42_42'></a><a href='#Footnote_42_42' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a> In ways too numerous
to mention Beethoven introduces life into
his work by constant variation of rhythmic
grouping.</p>

<p>As for harmonic variety, his daring was such
as to scandalize all the conservatives of his
generation. The First Symphony opens with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>[285]</a></span>
a passage of which Grove writes: &#8220;That a
composition professing to be in the key of C
should begin with a discord in the key of F,
and by the third bar be in that of G, was surely
startling enough to ears accustomed to the regular
processes of that time.&#8221; The passage did
in fact meet with strong opposition from such
critics as Preindl, Abbé Stadler, and Dionys
Weber. In the Second Symphony there are
many foretastes of the radical harmonic methods
Beethoven later developed. Returning to
his Restatement section, for instance, in the first
movement, the key of which is D, he reaches
the very remote key of C-sharp major, which
he emphasizes by a long reiteration of its tonic
chord, forte, lasting six full measures. Then,
with a diminuendo, a long C-sharp, in unison,
is held until, by the addition of an A, we are
made to feel that this C-sharp has become a
leading-note in the original key of D, and so
we are home again.<a name='FNanchor_43_43' id='FNanchor_43_43'></a><a href='#Footnote_43_43' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a> The coda of the same
movement contains one of those rapid, kaleidoscopic
modulations through many keys which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>[286]</a></span>
Beethoven knows how to use so excitingly. In
eleven measures we are bundled through G, B-flat,
A-minor, B-flat again, C-minor, E-flat
minor, F-sharp minor, and E, and after it all
find ourselves quite breathless, but safely home
again in D. Many similar passages of harmonic
virtuosity are to be found in the Second
Symphony; and they show Beethoven feeling
his way toward the wonderful flexibility of his
later harmonic style.</p>

<p>In his early thirties, then, at the close of his
apprenticeship or period of acquisition of resources
and establishment of technique, Beethoven
had in the first place thoroughly assimilated
the sonata-form developed by his forerunners
as the most convenient and natural
medium for the expression of the free, direct,
and widely eclectic secular spirit in music. He
had, in the second place, raised this form to
higher potencies of beauty and expressiveness,
by rigorous exclusion of what was superfluous
and inorganic in it, by purification of its texture
and strengthening of its essential structural features,
and by introduction into it, through the
power of his genius for composition, of more
subtle and more thoroughgoing contrasts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>[287]</a></span>
rhythm, harmony, and general expressive character.
Still he was not content. His soaring
idealism demanded a still greater flexibility of
form, as well as a more intense and intimate
utterance of feeling. &#8220;I am not satisfied,&#8221; he
wrote in 1802, &#8220;with my works up to the present
time. From to-day I mean to take a new
road.&#8221; What that road was, what superstructure
he proceeded to build on so solid a foundation,
we must now try to determine.

<p>History and analytic thought
alike reveal the fact that the highest
pinnacles of art can be scaled
only at those happy moments
when favoring conditions of two
distinct kinds happen to coincide. The artist
who is to attain supreme greatness must in the
first place have at his command a type of artistic
technique that has already been developed to the
verge of maturity, but that still awaits its complete
efflorescence. As Sir Hubert Parry well
says: &#8220;Inspiration without methods and means
at its disposal will no more enable a man to write
a symphony than to build a ship or a cathedral.&#8221;
These means must be already highly developed,
yet not to the point of exhaustion. If the technique
is primitive, no ardor of artistic enthusiasm
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>[292]</a></span>
can reach through it a full utterance; if all
its potencies have been actualized, no inspiration
can reanimate it.</p>

<p>In the second place, the artist so happy as to
inherit a technique ripe but not over-ripe, must
also, if he is to attain supreme greatness, be in
unison with the thought and feeling of his age,
echo from the common mind of his fellows a
deep, broad, and universal eloquence, as though
all mankind spoke through him as mouthpiece.
He must live in the midst of some great general
awakening of the human spirit, to which he
lends voice. Merely personal art can be interesting,
graceful, charming, moving, noble, but it
cannot have the profundity, the breadth, the elevation,
which we recognize in the highest art,
such as Greek sculpture, Elizabethan drama, or
the symphonic music we are now studying. &#8220;A
great man,&#8221; says Emerson, &#8220;finds himself in the
river of the thoughts and events, forced onward
by the ideas and necessities of his contemporaries.
He stands where all the eyes of men look
one way, and their hands all point in the direction
in which he should go. Every master has
found his materials collected, and his power lay
in his sympathy with his people and in his love
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>[293]</a></span>
of the materials he wrought in. Men, nations,
poets, artisans, women, all have worked for him,
and he enters into their labors.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_44_44' id='FNanchor_44_44'></a><a href='#Footnote_44_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a></p>

<p>When Beethoven resolved on his &#8220;new path,&#8221;
his ambition was favored by the two necessary
conditions. That he had at his command an inherited
technique, just brought to the verge of
maturity, we have already seen. And he had
furthermore, behind and below him, as a rich
nourishing soil for his genius, a great, new, common
enthusiasm of humanity.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century had been a time of
formalism in art and literature, of rigid conventionality
in social life, of paternalism in politics,
and of dogmatic ecclesiastical authority in religion.
At its end, however, all those dim, half-conscious
efforts of humanity towards freer and
fuller life which we have indicated under the
general term of idealism, were beginning to reach
definiteness and self-consciousness. Men were
beginning to assert deliberately and openly
what they had long been feeling intuitively
but insecurely. They were boldly erasing from
their standards the mediæval formula: &#8220;Poverty,
celibacy, and obedience,&#8221; to write in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>[294]</a></span>
place the modern one: &#8220;Life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.&#8221; They were revolting
from the tyrannies of Church and State, to proclaim
the sacredness of the individual soul.</p>

<p>It was Beethoven&#8217;s high privilege to be the
artistic spokesman of this new, enfranchised humanity.
Haydn, as we know, had reflected for
the first time in music the universal interest in
all kinds of human emotion, sacred and profane,
that marked the dawn of the new era. But in his
music the emotion remains naïve, impulsive,
childlike; it has not taken on the earnestness,
the sense of responsibility, of manhood. It is
still in the spontaneous stage, has not become
deliberate, resolute, purposeful. But with Beethoven
childishness is put away, and the new
spirit steps boldly out into the world, aware of
its obligations as well as of its privileges, clear-eyed,
sad, and serious, to live the full yet difficult
life of freedom.</p>

<p>The closeness of Beethoven&#8217;s relation to the
idealistic spirit of his time is shown equally by
two distinct yet supplementary aspects of his
work. As it was characteristic of the idealism
which fed him to set supreme store by human
emotion in all its intensity and diversity, so it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>[295]</a></span>
characteristic of his music to voice emotion with
a fullness, poignancy, definiteness, and variety
that sharply contrast it with the more formal
decorative music of his forerunners. And as it
was equally characteristic of idealism to recognize
the responsibilities of freedom, to restrain
and control all particular emotions in the interest
of a balanced spiritual life, so it was equally
characteristic of Beethoven to hold all his marvelous
emotional expressiveness constantly in
subordination to the integral effect of his composition
as a whole, to value plastic beauty
even more highly than eloquent appeal to feeling.
In other words, Beethoven the musician
is equally remarkable for two qualities, eloquence
of expression and beauty of form, which in his
best works are always held in an exact and firmly
controlled balance. And if we would fully understand
his supremacy, we must perceive not
only his achievements in both directions, but
the high artistic power with which he correlates
them. Just as the courage to insist on the rights
of the individual, and the wisdom to recognize
and support the rights of others, are the two
essentials of true idealism, so eloquence and
beauty are the equal requisites of genuine art.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>[296]</a></span></p>

<p>So closely interwoven, so mutually reactive,
are these twin merits of expression and form in
the great works of Beethoven&#8217;s prime&mdash;in the
pianoforte sonatas from the Waldstein to Opus
90, in the String Quartets, Opus 59 and 74, in
the fourth and fifth piano concertos and the
unique concerto for violin, in the Overture to
&#8220;Coriolanus,&#8221; the incidental music to &#8220;Egmont,&#8221;
and the opera, &#8220;Fidelio,&#8221; in the Mass in C, and
above all in the six great symphonies from the
&#8220;Eroica&#8221; to the Eighth&mdash;that it seems like
wanton violence and falsification to separate
them, even for the purposes of study. Synthesis,
at any rate, should go hand in hand with analysis;
we should constantly remember that the
various qualities our critical reagents discern in
this music, exist in it not, as in our analysis,
single and detached, but fused and interpenetrative
in one artistic whole. The chemist may find
carbon, and hydrogen, and oxygen in the rose,
but a rose is something more, something ineffably
more, than a compound of these chemical
elements.</p>

</div>

<p>If, bearing constantly in mind the artificiality
of analysis, we nevertheless attempt an enumeration
of separate qualities in Beethoven&#8217;s mature
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>[297]</a></span>
work, we are first of all arrested by the vigor,
definiteness, and variety of his expression. In
his symphonies from the Eroica on, for example,
there is a far more direct and poignant utterance
of a wide range of feeling, than we can find anywhere
in Haydn or Mozart, or in the early
Beethoven. The first &#8220;subjects&#8221; of the Third,
Fifth, Seventh and Eighth Symphonies, shown
in Figure XX, illustrate strikingly, brief as they
are, this diversity and force of the works of the
middle period. Who that had once heard them
could ever forget them? And who could ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>[298]</a></span>
confuse one with another? How they pierce
through the veil of the past, with their vibrant
accent of the living, breathing man!</p>

<p>Beethoven&#8217;s subjects, attaining so wonderful
a degree of individualization, mark the culminating
point of a long process of crystallization
of definite forms out of the tonal matrix of
earlier music. Ever since the Florentine reformers
essayed to infuse into academic art the
human expressiveness of idealized popular
songs and dances, the latent potentialities of
vocal phrases to express earnest emotion, and
of vigorous rhythms to express the more active
and animated feelings, had been becoming
more and more fully utilized. We saw
how the popular songs were embodied and
transfigured in the sarabandes and other slow,
serious movements of the eighteenth century
suites, and how the rhythms of the popular
dances were wrought into their idealized gavottes,
bourrées, minuets, and gigues.<a name='FNanchor_45_45' id='FNanchor_45_45'></a><a href='#Footnote_45_45' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a> We
saw how Haydn, in his naïve yet skillful way,
seized upon and refined the primitive but emotionally
vital folk-music of his race.<a name='FNanchor_46_46' id='FNanchor_46_46'></a><a href='#Footnote_46_46' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> We
saw how Mozart contributed still further, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>[299]</a></span>
his wonderful genius for organization, to the
progress in delicacy, variety, and breadth, of
the same type of art. And now we see, in Beethoven,
the issue of this long growth: we see
him bring to their apotheosis the eloquence of
the song and the animation of the dance; we
see him, by full utilization of the harmonic and
rhythmic potentialities of structure, by vigorous
exclusion of the irrelevant and the superfluous,
by full concentration of all his faculties of heart
and mind on the one idea in hand, attaining a
definiteness, a variety, and a compelling eloquence
of expression, that may fairly be said to
mark an epoch. Before Beethoven music was
already an art; with him it becomes also a language.</p>

<p>The variety of what Beethoven has to say is
as remarkable as the precision and force with
which he says it. To study him is to discern
the fallacy of the view so often heard that sentimental
expression is the only kind possible to
music. In Beethoven one can observe at least
four well-contrasted general types of expressiveness,
to say nothing of the infinite gradations
between them. There is, in the first place, and
as perhaps the dominant quality in all his work,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>[300]</a></span>
the virile energy, the massive and cyclopean
power, as of a giant or a god, so well illustrated
in the symphonic subjects of Figure XX.
What vigor, what inexhaustible force, what a
morning freshness and joy there is in such a
theme as that of the &#8220;Eroica&#8221; Symphony!
How inexorable is its rhythm, how broad, solid,
and simple its harmonic foundation! What
controlled excitement, what restrained ferocity,
there is in that persistent four-tone motif of
the Fifth Symphony&mdash;&#8220;Fate knocking at the
door&#8221;! What swift, concise assertiveness, as
in the fiat of an emperor, in the opening of the
Eighth Symphony, though it was called by Beethoven
&#8220;my little one&#8221;! Elemental strength
is the most constant, pervasive quality of expression
in Beethoven&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Yet, like every comprehensively great man
he had the feminine tenderness and sentiment
without which primal power is primitive, and
will mere willfulness. His ruggedness hid the
most delicate sensibility. At his most heroic
moments he is always melting into moods of
wistfulness, yearning, and soft emotion. To
go for illustration no further than the symphonies,
it is sufficient to mention, in the &#8220;Eroica,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>[301]</a></span>
the hesitant fervor of the second subject of the
first movement; the deep and noble pathos of the
subject of the Funeral March; the clear and rich
emotion of the Trio (in the third movement),
with its wonderful final strains, of which Sir
George Grove said: &#8220;If ever horns talked like
flesh and blood, they do it here;&#8221; in the Fifth
Symphony, the poignant appeal of the second
subject of the first movement, and the ceaselessly
questing, gently insistent mood of the
Andante; and in the Seventh, the resigned, yet
still aspiring state of feeling voiced by the melody
in A-major in the Allegretto. But it is impossible
to do more than shadow forth dimly,
in words, the emotions that glow with such deep
color in this music. Moreover, to enumerate
them is as unnecessary as it is thankless. Every
one who knows music at all, knows how incomparable
is Beethoven in the expression of all
shades of tender, romantic, and impassioned
human feeling.</p>

<p>A third sort of expression characteristic of
Beethoven is that of the whimsical, the perverse,
the irrepressibly gay. Before him, the classical
symphony had had room for the brisk jollity of
the Haydn finale and for the forthright animation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>[302]</a></span>
of the Mozart minuet; but nothing like
the Beethoven scherzo had existed. In Italian
the word scherzo means a joke; and when he
substituted the rollicking scherzo for the more
formal and stately minuet Beethoven introduced
into music the element of banter, mischief,
and whimsy. Even among his several
scherzos, there is such a diversity of mood that
they introduce into music far more than one new
kind of expression; their fancy is protean, inexhaustible.
The scherzo of the &#8220;Eroica&#8221; is a
mixture of mystery, gaiety, and headlong <i lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>elan</i>;
in that of the Fifth Symphony, a sort of groping
as in darkness alternates with incisive, grandiose,
military boldness; in the middle Allegro of
the Pastoral Symphony, taking the place of the
scherzo, there is rustic merry-making, the awkward,
good-natured gambols of peasants; in
the Presto of the Seventh, there is upwelling
geniality, the broad smile of amiable indolence;
and in the Minuet of the Eighth, the old
minuet stateliness gives place to a mixture of
animal spirits and intellectual subtlety. Nor are
the scherzos proper the only embodiment of
the antics of this musical Pan; such Finales as
those of the Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Symphonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>[303]</a></span>
are but transfigured, ennobled scherzos,
with the largeness of the heroic spirit added to
the fancy, whim, and tireless merriment of the
insatiable humorist. Beethoven is the extreme
exponent of the spirit of comedy in music.</p>

<p>A fourth mood distinguishable in Beethoven
is the mood of mystery. He loves to suggest
the illimitable and the transcendent, to dissolve
himself in vagueness; to pique curiosity and
stimulate imagination by long stretches of <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>pianissimo</i>,
of amorphous, ambiguous harmony,
of strange inarticulate melody that baffles the
attention&mdash;long, wide hushes, audible silences.
In these moods he seems to retire, after his onslaughts
of expression, into the deep subterranean
reservoirs of the unexpressed. The Introduction
to the Fourth Symphony is an example;
one hears in it, as it were, the groping
of vast unorganized impulses that await a birth.
The extended <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>pianissimo</i> passage that leads into
the Reprise, in the same movement, makes a
similar impression, the modulation to the home-key
of B-flat, after the long groping in B-major,
seeming like the opening of a window in a
darkened room. The wide stretches of rippling
violin figures, <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>piano</i>, in the &#8220;Scene by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>[304]</a></span>
Brook&#8221; of the Pastoral Symphony illustrate
another use of this device of monotony. They
affect the mind, as Beethoven meant they
should, like a placid sun-bathed landscape at
noon, flat, silent, motionless. But perhaps the
most striking instance of all is that wonderful
page in the Fifth Symphony that prepares for
the Finale. The sustained C&#8217;s of the strings,
the suppressed, barely audible tapping of the
drums in the rhythm of the central motif of
the work, the fragmentary, aimless, and yet cumulative
phrases of the violins, instil a sense of
some vast catastrophe impending; and then,
after the deliberate, gradual crescendo, pressing
upon every nerve, the great joyous theme of the
Finale crashes in, to sweep all before it.</p>

<p>Marvelous indeed is this varied and ever
forcible expression of feeling in the great works
of Beethoven&#8217;s maturity; but even more marvelous
is the steady power by which he organizes
these feelings into forms of perfect beauty, the
unfaltering control by which he keeps the intensely
characteristic from degenerating into
caricature, the impassioned from becoming hysterical.
He never forgets that, as an artist, he is
the master, not the slave, of his inspiration, however
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>[305]</a></span>
seizing it may be. Though he infuses into
music an eloquence new to it, he remembers that
it is still music, and that it must be beautiful as
music. Titanic were the labors he imposed upon
himself to give his compositions balance, symmetry,
logical coherence, integral unity emerging
from an infinite variety of parts. His sketch-books,
several of which, edited by Nottebohm,
have been published by Breitkopf and Härtel,
are the standing evidence of what endless effort
it cost him to be an artist. In them we
behold him at work, day by day, eliminating
the irrelevant, reinforcing the significant, exploring
the sources of melodic, rhythmic, harmonic,
and structural variety, and returning
upon his task to gather up all the threads into
one complete, close-woven fabric. The result
was a type of music seldom equalled, before or
since, for that ordered richness, that complex
simplicity, which is beauty.</p>

<p>An example or two will make this clearer
than much description. The first subject of the
Fifth Symphony, one of the most famous of
Beethoven&#8217;s themes, is entirely made up of ingenious
combinations of the &#8220;Fate Knocking
at the Door&#8221; motif, as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>[306]</a></span></p>

<p class='center3 ebhide'><a href='music/score_pag306.mp3'>[Listen]</a></p>

<div class='caption'>FIGURE XXI.</div>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>[307]</a></span></p>

<p>How wonderful here is the stern and relentless
logic of that insistently repeated rhythm, the
utter naturalness of the melody which builds itself
out of the various repetitions of the theme in
different voices, and the rugged strength of the
harmonic scheme of the entire passage! Had
we not documentary evidence, we should find
it hard to believe that this was not a sudden
and complete thought, struck out by Beethoven
at a blow in some moment of high musical
excitement. Yet his sketch-book reveals that
it grew by a very gradual process of amendment
and refining from the monotonous, uninteresting,
almost fatuous bit of patchwork shown in
Figure XXII. Another, slightly more advanced,
state of the same idea is shown in Figure
XXIII. In both these passages the rhythm
is almost the only element that even dimly suggests
the august gravity of the final version; for
the rest, these first attempts are depressingly futile.</p>

<p>The well-known and universally admired
subject of the Andante of the Fifth Symphony
is another illustration of Beethoven&#8217;s artistic
power. That was a rare skill indeed which
could educe, even after long labor, this beautifully
modulated and sustained theme (Figure
XXIV), so subtle and varied in contour, from
the trite embryo noted in Figure XXV.</p>

<p>The evolution of Beethoven&#8217;s almost perfect
ideas from their strangely featureless and uninteresting
germs can perhaps be shown best of all,
however, by the citation of several consecutive
stages in the history of some single notable conception.
The indescribably lovely second subject
of the first movement of the Eroica Symphony
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>[311]</a></span>
is shown in its final form at (e) of
Figure XXVI; (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the
same figure being a few of the many sketches
through which Beethoven approached it. The
points of especial beauty in the matured theme
appear sporadically in the earlier sketches. Of
these the chief are: the insistent beat of the
rhythm; the impressive cadence in the fourth
measure and the beat of silence following it in
the fifth; the rise to the poignant G in the seventh
measure, and the lapse by rapid motion
down to B-flat again; the sudden assumption
of the minor mode in measure 9, and the modulation
to the distant key of D-flat it suggests;
and the uneven yet satisfying balance of the
three complete phrases, together with the sense
of being poised in air given by the sudden
cessation of the rhythmic pulse at a point so
distant from the key. The rhythm appears in
the very first sketch, marked (a); the cadence
and beat of silence appear in (b), as does also
the rise to G in the melody, except that the G
is flatted, slightly sentimentalizing the effect.
The modulation to the key of D-flat appears in
(c) and (d), but in each case its effectiveness is
much weakened by the quickly succeeding further
modulation. The sense of poise referred
to is entirely lacking in these two variants, because
a fourth phrase is added to the three essential
ones. In the final form all the effects
are made with certainty and economy.</p>

<p>Beethoven&#8217;s method of drafting and re-drafting
his subjects enabled him to bring them at
last to a formal perfection undreamed of by less
painstaking composers. His best themes combine
almost the highest possible degree of variety
and unity, and therefore attain almost
the highest possible degree of beauty. We saw,
in connection with the Quintet of Mozart (Figure
XVIII), how high synthetic powers of
mind enable a composer to combine different
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_315' id='Page_315'>[315]</a></span>
motifs in one theme in such a way as to attain
great variety of parts with final unity of impression.
Beethoven exhibits constantly, in his
best work, an even higher degree of this synthetic
power than Mozart was master of. He
knew how to build the most diverse materials
into a compact, indissoluble organism. His
briefest themes often discover this power as
strikingly as his long and elaborate movements.
The first theme of the Sonata in A-major for
Violoncello and Piano, which appears in Figure
XXVII, is an example of the way the
faculty shows itself within narrow limits. Here
are six measures, each containing a different
scheme of time values; yet the theme as a whole
is as compelling in its unity and certainty of
intention as it is engaging in its variety.</p>

</div>

<p>The exploitation of the primary themes in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>[316]</a></span>
the course of a long movement, however, the
constant evocation from them of new meanings
and interests, is of course the last and finest evidence
of Beethoven&#8217;s genius in composition. It
was in this logical drawing forth of the implications
of his thought that he was unapproachable.
He uses to admiration all those devices
of development we have already enumerated&mdash;inversion,
augmentation, diminution, shifted
rhythm, and the rest&mdash;yet never descends to the
mechanical, as his great successor, Brahms, who
is perhaps the only modern composer who compares
with him in this faculty of logical development
of an idea, sometimes does. Beethoven
always seems to be merely making explicit
what was implied in the theme itself.</p>

<p>In Figure XXVIII are put down a few of the
more important modifications of the first subject
of the Eroica Symphony, as an illustration
of the inexhaustibility of fancy displayed by
Beethoven in this sort of development. (a)
is the theme in its initial form. Note how,
with that mysterious C-sharp in the bass,
in the fifth measure, the outline is momentarily
blurred, and the insistence on the tones of the
triad relaxed, until with measure 7 the key is
re-entered and the sentence soon brought to a
firm conclusion. No one but Beethoven could
ever have conceived that C-sharp. In (b), which
follows, in the score, immediately on (a), the
second half of the motif is made the subject of
a development by repetition, at a higher and
higher pitch. In (c), which occurs after the
second subject, and near the end of the first
section of the entire movement, the same portion
of the motif is further exploited. For the first
four measures it is thrown back and forth in
imitation. In the fifth, sixth and seventh measures
it is given to the bass, in <em>diminution</em> (note
how piquantly) and in the eighth measure it is
both diminished and inverted, yet without giving
the slightest impression of artificiality. The
subject appears at (d), which is a part of the
working-out portion of the movement, in the
minor key, and rapidly modulating to distant
keys, as is appropriate in that part of the composition
the aim of which is to contrast with
the definiteness, orderliness, and precision of
the Exposition. At (e) the subject, still in
minor, is heard in the bass, while the treble has
as a counterpoint to it a tripping rhythm derived
from another part of the original material.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_321' id='Page_321'>[321]</a></span>
At (f), becoming emphatic, magniloquent,
the theme is sounded <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>forte</i>, and in unison by
the whole orchestra, and extended by a natural
magnification to an eight-measure phrase. This
is developed at some length in the score. (g)
is the beginning of the Coda. In one of Beethoven&#8217;s
breathless <i lang='it' xml:lang='it'>pianissimos</i>, the subject is
given by the second violins on their G-strings,
the first violins meanwhile embroidering in an
elastic staccato the most indescribably merry,
light-hearted little counter-melody. From the
freshness of this, one might fancy that the work
was just opening rather than drawing to its close.
Truly, Beethoven&#8217;s imagination is like some
friendly genie of the Arabian Nights, filling our
cup of enjoyment as fast as it is drained.</p>

<p>The mental power that in the preliminary parts
of composition reveals itself merely as a remarkable
ingenuity, inventiveness, and elasticity of
mind, appears, when contemplated in its larger
action, almost superhuman in its breadth of
grasp. In the conception and execution of a
great symphonic work, as an integral whole of
many and diverse parts, Beethoven is unapproachable.
All the successive movements in a
long work, all the themes and transitions, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_322' id='Page_322'>[322]</a></span>
the rhythmic changes, all the modulations, temporary
or prolonged, are foreseen and adjusted
with perfect control. There is no feature of any
moment that has not its relation to the whole.
Often the reason of some apparent whim will
not appear for pages; but at last it will appear,
and when it does it will be seen to fulfil a purpose
never lost sight of. As a turret or window
at the extreme end of a building may balance
a similar feature at the other end, so Beethoven&#8217;s
treatment of a given theme, early in
a movement, may be determined and illuminated
by what he finally does to it in the Coda.
So integral is his work, so firmly held in the
grip of his inexorable artistic logic.</p>

<p>Beauty, in the great compositions of his prime,
is therefore as omnipresent as expression; and
their supreme greatness is in fact due to the perfect
balance, in them, of these two equally important
elements of musical effect. Before passing
on to the consideration of his later years, it
will be well to make still clearer the fact of this
balance of qualities by a brief reference to the
highly interesting and significant attitude of Beethoven
towards program music.</p>

<p>Program music differs from pure music in being
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_323' id='Page_323'>[323]</a></span>
aimed rather at the literal imitation or delineation
of objects and events in the natural
world than at the presentation, through orderly
and consequently beautiful tone-combinations,
of the general emotions that they arouse.
Schütz, a very early German composer, depicting
by a long downward scale an angel descending
from heaven; Beethoven, introducing the
notes of the nightingale, quail, and cuckoo in
his Pastoral Symphony; Schubert, writing in the
accompaniment of his song, &#8220;The Trout,&#8221; a
leaping figure suggestive of the motions of the
fish in the water; Raff, sounding the rhythm of
a galloping horse all through the ride-movement
of his Lenore Symphony: Wagner, imitating
in the &#8220;Waldweben&#8221; the murmurings of the
forest; all these composers are writing program
music. Of course there is no reason that program
music should not be at the same time
pure music, provided that the desire to imitate
nature accurately does not lead the composer to
slight the requirements of plastic beauty in the
ordering and combination of his material. A
portrait may be good decoration, if composition,
massing, light and shade, coloring, and so on,
are not sacrificed to a pitiless realism. Just so,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_324' id='Page_324'>[324]</a></span>
program music can be made beautiful, if the
needs of abstract tonal beauty are duly considered.</p>

<p>But as a usual thing they are not. The program
composer generally makes a fetish of his
&#8220;idea,&#8221; pursues it with the enthusiasm of the
literalist, and quite neglects the formal symmetry,
the stylistic congruity and harmony, of
his web of tones. The result is that program
music is as a rule more interesting than moving;
that in attempting to make pure sounds
do what words, or even colors and shapes, can
do better, it sacrifices the legitimate and characteristic
effect of tones&mdash;the suggestion of a
general state of feeling, potent by reason of its
very vagueness, and transfigured by the abstract
beauty of its medium.</p>

<p>Now Beethoven was obliged in his early maturity
to face and solve this problem of program
music for himself. His intense individualism,
his susceptibility to strong feeling, his natural interest
in the characteristic, the dramatic, the
definite, and the opportunity he found, in
music as he received it from his forerunners,
for a more detailed expressiveness than had yet
been attempted, all inclined him to take the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_325' id='Page_325'>[325]</a></span>
attitude of the program composer. The poetic
conception of a work was so clear and distinct
in his mind that he could easily assign it a descriptive
title. He called his third symphony
&#8220;The Eroica,&#8221; his sixth the &#8220;Pastoral,&#8221; and
said that the motif of the fifth indicated &#8220;Fate
Knocking at the Door.&#8221; He called one of his
piano sonatas &#8220;Les Adieux, l&#8217;Absence et le
Retour;&#8221; of another, that in G-major, Opus
14, he said, &#8220;It is a dialogue between husband
and wife, or lover and mistress; between
the entreating and the resisting principle;&#8221;
he tacitly admitted that the sonatas in F-minor,
Opus 57, and in D-minor, Opus 29, were illustrative
of Shakespeare&#8217;s Tempest. Other works,
not specifically named by him, wore very naturally
titles given by others: as the &#8220;Pastoral Sonata,&#8221;
the &#8220;Moonlight Sonata,&#8221; and the &#8220;Sonata Appassionata.&#8221;
At the same period that he was
writing these instrumental works with programmistic
aspect, he wrote also his incidental music
descriptive of Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Egmont,&#8221; his overture
on the subject of &#8220;Coriolanus,&#8221; and his single
opera, &#8220;Fidelio.&#8221; Of interpretation he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Though the poet carries on his monologue,
or dialogue, in a progressively marked rhythm,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>[326]</a></span>
yet the declaimer, for the more accurate elucidation
of the sense, must make cæsuras and
pauses in places where the poet could not venture
on any interpunctuation. To this extent,
then, is this style of declaiming applicable to
music, and it is only to be modified according
to the number of persons cooperating in the
performance of a musical composition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet in spite of all these indications of the
direction in which music was moving with Beethoven,
his instinct for beauty kept him from
allowing mere delineation to become his ideal.
As Sir Hubert Parry well says, the Pastoral
Symphony is like a manifesto on that point. Of
all Beethoven&#8217;s works, it ventures farthest into
the domain of program music. It contains actual
imitations of sounds and sights in nature,
as the rippling of the brook (strings); the muttering
of thunder (contrabasses in their low register);
flashes of lightning (violins); the bassoon
of an old peasant sitting on a barrel, and
able to play but three tones; and the song of
the nightingale (flute), quail (oboe), and cuckoo
(clarinet.) All the movements bear descriptive
titles, as follows: &#8220;The awakening of happy
feelings on arriving in the country; Scene by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>[327]</a></span>
brook; Merry gathering of peasants; Thunderstorm;
Shepherd&#8217;s song&mdash;Rejoicings and thankfulness
after the storm.&#8221; It is obvious that here
Beethoven was pushing the descriptive power of
music to its limits. Yet it is important to note
that even here neither his instinctive sense of
the proper uses of the musical art nor his reasoned
conviction as to the nature of musical expression
forsook him. Throughout the growlings
of the thunder, the music pursues its way
coherently and accordingly to its own laws. The
rhythmic scheme and the harmonic sequence are
maintained, and the general structure is not for
a moment forgotten. After the imitation of the
bird-notes, in the second movement, the musical
sentence is rounded out to completion by the
lovely concluding phrase, imitated by various
instruments. (See Fig. XXIX).</p>

<p>It is only necessary to play the bird-notes
alone, omitting the supplementary phrase, to see
how much of the effect is a matter of pure
music. And that Beethoven realized this himself,
that he was clearly aware that music affects
us more by setting up vague but potent emotions
in us by means of a beautiful embodiment
of expressive sounds than by merely copying
what is in the actual world, is evidenced by the
motto he inscribes at the head of his score:
&#8220;Mehr Ausdruck der Empfindung als Malerei&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;More
the expression of feeling than painting.&#8221;
Even more succinct, if that is possible, is
a note in one of his sketch books: &#8220;Pastoral
Symphony: no picture, but something in which
the emotions are expressed which are aroused in
men by the pleasure of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>This attitude of Beethoven&#8217;s towards program
music, both in practice and in theory, is but a
crucial and striking example of his general attitude
towards music, an attitude produced both
by the tendencies of the historic moment and
by his native genius. Had he had less capacity
or taste for expression of the most definite and
vivid emotions, he would not have been able to
carry music beyond the formalism of Haydn
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_331' id='Page_331'>[331]</a></span>
and Mozart, and to make it voice the self-conscious
idealism, the romantic intensity, the various,
many-sided, and profound spiritual life, of
modern men. Had he not, on the other hand,
clung pertinaciously to the plastic beauty which,
after all, is the most indispensable quality of
musical art, had he allowed his interest in the
characteristic to betray him into literalism, he
would have deprived music of that period of full
maturity which he represents, and ushered in too
soon the inevitable decadence, in which art is no
longer whole and balanced, but seeks special effects
and particular expressions, becomes meteoric,
dazzling, and fragmentary. That period
was bound to come, as the parabola must make
its descending as well as its ascending curve,
or the plant have its autumn as well as its
spring and summer. But before the appealing,
but pathetically incomplete work of the
romanticists came to give a sort of Indian summer
brightness to the musical year, it was meet
that it should have its full harvest of ripe, sound,
and wholesome beauty. And this it had, in
the incomparably sane and noble works of the
mature Beethoven.

<p class='p4 center'>CHAPTER IX<br />
CONCLUSION</p>


<p>The third and last period of Beethoven&#8217;s
life, from 1813 to 1827,
during which he produced the
remarkable later pianoforte sonatas
and string quartets, the
Quintet, opus 104, the Wind Octet, opus 103,
the noble Missa Solemnis, which he considered
his greatest work, and the immortal Ninth
or Choral Symphony, was a time of affliction
and wretchedness. The record of these bitter
years of the deaf, lonely, poverty-hounded master,
surrounded by unfeeling relatives and indifferent
and dishonest servants, stricken with
disease, and laboring through all to realize his
grand artistic conceptions, is relieved only by
his unflinching fortitude and grim humor. The
heroic spirit of the man matched his misfortunes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_336' id='Page_336'>[336]</a></span>
For him, if for any one, the boast of
the stoic poet would have been justifiable:</p>


<div class='verse'>&#8220;In the fell clutch of circumstance</div>
<div class='verse ileft2'>I have not winced nor cried aloud;</div>
<div class='verse'>Under the bludgeonings of chance</div>
<div class='verse ileft2'>My head is bloody but unbowed.&#8221;</div>


<p>There was something almost diabolically sinister
in the fate that placed Beethoven, so sensitive
to personalities, so peculiarly in need of
tranquillity for the pursuit of his ideas, in the
midst of such a pack of rascally kindred. The
great canker of his life was his nephew, Carl,
left his ward, in 1815, by the death of his
brother. A loafer in billiard-rooms, a devotee
of cheap amours, a dissipated, frivolous, and
wholly irreverent weakling, this young man
looked upon his uncle simply as a source of florins,
having apparently no respect for his age,
his sufferings, or his genius. To make matters
worse, Beethoven found it necessary, in order
to secure the boy&#8217;s custody, to go to law against
his mother, whom he picturesquely and significantly
named &#8220;The Queen of the Night.&#8221; He
was involved in endless lawsuits to gain the very
responsibilities which proved so heavy and so
fruitless. Carl rewarded all this care and love
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_337' id='Page_337'>[337]</a></span>
by holding clandestine meetings with his mother,
by squandering his uncle&#8217;s hard-earned
money, by neglecting the commissions which
the composer, deaf and ill, was obliged to entrust
to him; and finally, brought to the verge
of despair by his own weakness, he attempted
suicide, was locked up in an asylum, and was
eventually packed off to the army. In all Beethoven&#8217;s
struggles with his nephew he got no
help from the boy&#8217;s other uncle, the &#8220;land-owner&#8221;
of the anecdote, Johann van Beethoven,
whom the composer bitterly called his
&#8220;pseudo-brother.&#8221; This complacent apothecary
saw no need of helping a brother who was
one of the greatest artists living, and whose life
was being slowly sapped by sordid anxieties.
Doubtless Beethoven was a man difficult to help&mdash;a
man of high temper, perverse whims, uncompromising
speech. But the story, nevertheless,
is an unpleasant one, in which young Carl
and old Johann Beethoven play unenviable
rôles.</p>

<p>In his contact with these wretched relatives
Beethoven was not supported by a comfortable,
congenial home. A bachelor, poor, absent-minded,
and engrossed in abstract pursuits, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>[338]</a></span>
was at the mercy of rapacious landlords and
self-seeking or incompetent servants. After
1816, when, largely for his nephew&#8217;s sake, he
began keeping house, he was given hardly a
moment of ease by what he called his &#8220;domestic
rabble.&#8221; His letters are full of indignant protests
or half-humorous jibes against the old
&#8220;witch,&#8221; or &#8220;Satanas,&#8221; as he called his housekeeper&mdash;a
half-crazy beldame who not only
neglected his table and let the dust thicken on
his books, but on one occasion actually used
the manuscript of a part of his great Mass to
wrap around old boots. &#8220;My dear Son,&#8221; he
writes (it was thus that he habitually addressed
his nephew), &#8220;It is impossible to permit this
to continue any longer; no soup to-day, no
beef, no eggs, and at last <em>broiled meat</em> from the
inn! Little as I require what nourishes the
body, as you know, still the present state of
things is really too bad, besides being every moment
in danger of being poisoned.&#8221; Another
time he exclaims: &#8220;Here comes <em>Satanas</em>....
What a reproach to our civilization to stand
in need of a class like this, and to have those
whom we despise constantly near us.&#8221; How
must Beethoven have felt when the nephew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_339' id='Page_339'>[339]</a></span>
whom he had trusted as a son descended so
low as to borrow money surreptitiously from,
this very &#8220;Satanas&#8221;? &#8220;Last Sunday,&#8221; he
writes, &#8220;you again borrowed 1 florin 15 kreutzers
from the housekeeper, from a mean old
kitchen wench,&mdash;this was already forbidden,&mdash;and
it is the same in all things. What avail
even the most gentle reproofs? They merely
serve to embitter you. But do not be uneasy;
I shall continue to care for you as much as
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another constant harassment of Beethoven
in his later years was poverty. The annuity settled
upon him by his patrons was so seriously
decreased by a depreciation in the value of paper
money and by the deaths of some of the
donors that it eventually amounted to only four
hundred dollars a year. &#8220;If my salary,&#8221; he
wrote in 1822, &#8220;were not so far reduced as to
be no salary at all, I would write nothing but
symphonies for a full orchestra, and church
music, or at most quartets.&#8221; As it was, he had
to devote a part of his time to writing for money,
a servitude intensely distasteful to one so devoted
to high artistic ideals, so constitutionally incapable
of compromise. He puts the best face
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_340' id='Page_340'>[340]</a></span>
on the matter, jokes about it as he does about
everything; but it is obvious that he suffered
much to gather the florins his nephew so easily
spent. &#8220;I wander about here with music paper,
among the hills and dales and valleys, and
scribble a great deal to get my daily bread; for
I have brought things to such a pass ...
that in order to gain time for a great composition,
I must always previously scrawl away a
good deal for the sake of money.&#8221; But his attitude
towards publishers remained dignified,
considerate; he knew how to respect his own
work and rights without falling into the petty
egotism of the so-called &#8220;artistic temperament.&#8221;
&#8220;I must apprise you,&#8221; he writes Herr Peters of
the well-known Leipzig publishing house, &#8220;that
I cannot accept less than 50 ducats for a string
quartet, and 70 for a pianoforte one, without
incurring loss; indeed, I have repeatedly been
offered more than 50 ducats for a violin quartet.
I am, however, always unwilling to ask
more than necessary, so I adhere to the sum of
50 ducats, which is, in fact, nowadays the usual
price. I feel positively ashamed when I have
to ask a price for a really great work. Still, such
is my position that it obliges me to secure every
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_341' id='Page_341'>[341]</a></span>
possible advantage. It is very different, however,
with the work itself; when I never, thank
God, think of profit, but solely of how I write
it.&#8221; It is a similar dignified sense of his responsibilities,
far removed from vanity, that prompts
him to request of an editor notice of his nomination
as an honorary member of the Royal
Swedish Musical Academy. &#8220;Although neither
vain nor ambitious,&#8221; he says, &#8220;still I consider
it advisable not wholly to pass over such an occurrence,
as in practical life we must live and
work for others, who may often eventually benefit
by it.&#8221; The sincerity of these convictions is
proved by the fact that after Beethoven&#8217;s death
in poverty, eight bank-shares were found among
his papers, carefully preserved by him for the
legacy of his nephew.</p>

<p>Beethoven&#8217;s deafness went on steadily increasing.
That is a pathetic picture his friend Schindler
gives of him, improvising with all the enthusiasm
of his inner inspiration on the violin or
the viola, which, because of his inability to tune
them, gave out the most distressing, discordant
sounds. On the piano it was but little better;
he had to guide himself largely by sight, and
his touch became harsh and heavy. The effect
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>[342]</a></span>
of this malady on his character, already mentioned
in Chapter VII, and recognized by himself
in his &#8220;Will,&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_47_47' id='FNanchor_47_47'></a><a href='#Footnote_47_47' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a> grew as time went on more
profound. He became morbidly suspicious,
withdrew himself entirely from casual social intercourse,
and distrusted even his best friends.
Friendly consultations in his behalf he interpreted
as collusions against him, and resented
with all the violent anger of his intense, willful,
and frank nature. When Lichnowsky,
Schuppanzigh, and Schindler met at his room,
as if by chance, to discuss a concert they were
planning for the presentation of the Missa Solemnis
and the Ninth Symphony, his suspicions
were so aroused that he wrote the three faithful
disciples as follows:</p>

<p>To Lichnowsky:</p>

<p>&#8220;Insincerity I despise; visit me no more;
my concert is not to take place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beethoven.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Schuppanzigh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come no more to see me. I give no concert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beethoven.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_343' id='Page_343'>[343]</a></span></p>
<p>To Schindler:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not come to me till I summon you.
No concert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beethoven.&#8221;</p>


<p>The dogmatic, domineering habit of mind here
illustrated, the obverse side of Beethoven&#8217;s
strong will and high self-reliance, doubtless did
much to intensify the loneliness and the difficulties
of his old age. Yet even here there is
something noble, something that commands as
much admiration as pity, about this wounded
hero, this lion at bay.</p>

<p>The last scene of Beethoven&#8217;s troublous life
opens in October, 1826, when, already aged and
broken, though but fifty-six years old, he was
obliged to seek, in the house of his &#8220;pseudo-brother&#8221;
Johann, at Krems, fifty miles from Vienna,
a refuge for Carl, who had been ordered
out of Vienna by the civil authorities after his
attempt at suicide. Sir George Grove gives a
picture of the oddly-assorted group of actors:
&#8220;The pompous money-loving land-proprietor;
his wife, a common frivolous woman of questionable
character; the ne&#8217;er-do-well nephew,
intensely selfish and ready to make game of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_344' id='Page_344'>[344]</a></span>
uncle or to make love to his aunt; and in the
midst of them all the great composer&mdash;deaf, untidy,
unpresentable, setting every household rule
at defiance, by turns entirely absorbed and pertinaciously
boisterous, exploding in rough jokes
and hoarse laughter, or bursting into sudden
fury at some absolute misconception.&#8221; Beethoven,
whose health was already seriously undermined,
was obliged to sit in a cold room at
his work, his brother being unwilling to go to
the expense of a fire, and to eat unwholesome,
ill-cooked food, for which however board-money
was rigorously exacted. By early December
there was an open rupture between the two
brothers, and the composer and Carl, resolved
to leave the place, yet denied the closed carriage
of the niggardly Johann, risked the fifty-mile
journey, in winter weather, in a hired open
wagon. It was Beethoven&#8217;s death blow. Reaching
home after two days&#8217; exposure, he took to
his bed, with his digestive troubles much aggravated,
and an inflammation of the lungs. A
little later dropsy set in, and four operations had
to be undergone. As the doctors drew out the
water Beethoven said grimly: &#8220;Better from my
belly than from my pen.&#8221; Early in the new
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>[345]</a></span>
year he rallied, and planned fresh compositions.
He amused himself with the romances of Scott,
but at last threw them down, exclaiming angrily:
&#8220;The man writes for money.&#8221; Soon he began
to fail again. On March 24th, rapidly sinking,
he just found strength to whisper to the friends
at his bedside: &#8220;Plaudite, amici, commèdia finita
est.&#8221; After a desperate struggle of two days,
his vigorous constitution at last succumbed, and
he died on the evening of March 26th, 1827.</p>

<p>Of the compositions of Beethoven&#8217;s last period
the most conflicting opinions have been
held. Musicians of the Wagner and Liszt
school have seen in the Ninth Symphony the
opening of a door into a new realm of art, greater,
freer, more deeply expressive than any that had
gone before. Critics less in sympathy with the
tendencies of romanticism, however, have interpreted
the last phase of Beethoven&#8217;s career as a
decadence, the necessary result of flagging vitality
and of his previous exhaustion of the legitimate
effects of pure music. They have pointed
out that his deafness made him indifferent to the
actual sensuous effect of his combinations of
tone; that his increasing fondness for the subtleties
of polyphony was not supported by adequate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>[346]</a></span>
early training; and that the isolation and
sufferings of his life gradually undermined the
sanity and marred the balance of his art. Probably
there is some truth in each of these views.</p>

<p>It is certain that Beethoven, in his last quartets
and pianoforte sonatas, and in the Ninth
Symphony, showed for the first time the feasibility
of those special, highly individualized expressions
of feeling in music which were afterwards
wrought out in great variety and profusion
by Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn,
Chopin, Liszt, and the other composers of the
Romantic school. He not only made music,
as we have already seen, a language as well as
an art, but he set the fashion, in his last compositions,
of regarding its powers of eloquent and
definite utterance as of even greater importance
than its general plastic beauty. From the point
of view of interest, this was an advance; and
judged from this standpoint Beethoven was a
pioneer in that movement towards characteristic
expression which has been so important a part
of the musical activity of our time.</p>

<p>But every advance, in art as well as in life,
is made at a certain cost, and the price of this
increase in complexity and preciseness of expression
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_347' id='Page_347'>[347]</a></span>
was a loss of artistic wholeness and
poise. As a monument of pure beauty embodied
in tones, the Ninth Symphony hardly
holds its own beside the Eighth, so much
smaller and less ambitious. One misses in it
the sense of reserve power, of restraint, of
firmly controlled balance of means and ends.
The passionate spirit of the work jars and disrupts
its body. Music is strained to its limit
of power; and great as is the result, the success
seems too much like a feat of genius, done in
despite of natural laws. In all Beethoven&#8217;s
later works there is this uncomfortable sense
of strain and labor. He achieves the well-nigh
impossible, but it is at the cost of serenity.</p>

<p>In view of the circumstances, we may think
it could hardly have been otherwise. Long-continued
deafness had made Beethoven insensitive
to the sensuous basis of music. He
considered less and less the actual sound of his
fabric of tones, more and more their purely intellectual
and ideal relations. The pages of the
final sonatas and quartets bristle with passages
as distressing to hear as they are interesting to
contemplate. This tendency to harshness was
reinforced by his growing addiction to contrapuntal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_348' id='Page_348'>[348]</a></span>
writing. His natural style was that
monophonic or harmonic style initiated by the
Florentine reformers and passed on to him
through Haydn and Mozart. But as he meditated,
ever more profoundly, he came to see its
inadequacy, and constantly felt out more and
more in the direction of polyphony; he endeavored
to graft the fugue and the canon upon
sonata-form. His early training, however, was
insufficient for such a task; his limitations in
counterpoint had been correctly gauged by his
teacher, Albrechtsberger; and when in his maturity
he attempted to write polyphonically, he
became crabbed, awkward, and discordant. His
instinct was right, but his skill did not support
him. In choral writing, again, to which he devoted
himself with increasing enthusiasm as he
grew older, he was at a disadvantage. He disregarded
the natural conditions of the voice;
he never really mastered vocal style; and when
he introduced a chorus into his last and most
gigantic symphony, he attempted more than he
could satisfactorily execute. The choral part
of that symphony is exceedingly difficult; and
the audience is made almost as uneasy by it as
the chorus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_349' id='Page_349'>[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The isolation in which he finally came to live,
and the natural independence of his character,
added their influence to those of physical and
technical limitations. As he cared less for general
intelligibility, and more for the logical carrying
out, to their extremes, of the implications of
his ideas, his music became more and more abstruse.
His constantly increasing interest in intellectual
subtleties, on which his great and lonely
mind naturally concentrated itself, was not regulated
by a sufficient perception of the sensuous
qualities of his work&mdash;for he was deaf; and
consequently the balance was destroyed, the
great sanative touch of the actual was lost, and
his music became distorted and grotesque. Some
of the fugues in his later quartets and piano sonatas
sound more like audible problems in chess
or mathematics than like &#8220;the concord of sweet
sounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suffering so extreme as Beethoven&#8217;s had its
inevitable effect, too, on the whole general tone
and quality of his artistic utterance. He learned
the lessons of sorrow as few men have ever
learned them; temporal misfortune taught him
to impersonalize his ideals, to turn to the eternal
sources of hope in his inmost spirit, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_350' id='Page_350'>[350]</a></span>
interpret the joys and sorrows not of his separate
self merely, but of all humanity; but at the
same time that his spirit was thus chastened,
purified, and expanded, it was shorn of its
primitive vigor, its pristine elasticity, energy,
and animation. If the music of his prime is
the music of pagan idealism, that of his later
years is the music of stoicism&mdash;the stern and
noble stoicism of Marcus Aurelius, touched with
the tenderness and spiritual joy of Christ. It
breathes a high serenity, a transfigured human
happiness, attainable only to a great soul after
much suffering. If any mortal artist could be
justified in such a boast, Beethoven was justified
when he wrote: &#8220;I do not fear for my works.
No evil can befall them; and whosoever shall
understand them, he shall be freed from all the
misery that burdens mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we take a last backward glance over the
life of Beethoven, and over that larger life of
the art of music in the classical period, of which
it was the final stage, we cannot but be profoundly
impressed by the unity and continuity of the
whole evolution. From its first slight and tentative
beginnings in the experiments of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_351' id='Page_351'>[351]</a></span>
Florentine reformers, secular music, the art of
expressing through the medium of tones, the
full, free, and harmonious emotional life of
modern idealism gradually acquired, through the
labors of the seventeenth-century composers,
definiteness of aim and technical resources.
Then, in the work of Haydn and Mozart, it
reached the stage of maturity, of self-consciousness;
it became flexible, various, many-sided,
adequate to the demands made upon it; it
emerged from childhood, and took its honored
place in the circle of independent and recognized
arts. Finally, it was brought by Beethoven
to its ripe perfection, its full flowering. It
was made to say all that, within its native limitations,
it was capable of saying. It reached
the fullness of life beyond which it could live
only by breaking itself up into new types, as
the old plant scatters forth seeds. And even
these new types were dimly divined, and suggested
to his successors, by Beethoven. Was it
not his effort to express, in absolute music, the
most various shades of personal, highly specialized
feeling, vigorous, sentimental, mystical, or
elfishly wayward, that inspired the romantic
composers, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, and

their fellows, to pursue even further the same
quest? Was it not his feeling out toward novel
dramatic effects in the combined chorus and orchestra,
in the Ninth Symphony, that showed
Wagner the path he must take? Was it not
his attempts, defeated by insufficient technical
skill, to combine the polyphony of the sixteenth
century with the harmonic and rhythmic structure
of the nineteenth, that suggested to Brahms,
more fully equipped, his great enterprise? Thus
even the failures of a great man are full of promise;
and Beethoven, and all his forerunners too,
still live and speak to us in the music of to-day.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
